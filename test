handles and knobs when available.
3. This appliance must be properly
installed and located in accordance
with these instructions before
it is used.

not recommended by the appliance
manufacturer may result in fire,
electrical shock, or injury
to persons.
5. Do not place on or near a hot
gas or electric burner, or in a
heated oven.
6. Do not use outdoors.
7. To protect against fire, electric
shock, and injury do not immerse
cords, plugs, or the appliance in
water or any other liquid.
8. Do not fill the Water Reservoir
above the MAX FILL line.
9. Use only water in this appliance!
Do not put any other liquids or
foods in the Water Reservoir
except as instructed in the cleaning
instructions in this guide.
10. Turn off and unplug the brewer
before cleaning or maintenance.
Allow to cool before putting on
or taking off parts and before
cleaning the appliance.
11. For best operation, plug the
appliance into its own electrical
outlet on a dedicated circuit to
prevent flickering of lights,
blowing of fuses, or tripping
a circuit breaker.
12. Do not operate any appliance with
a damaged Power Cord or plug or
after the appliance malfunctions
or is damaged in any manner.

IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS
17. Always keep the Water Reservoir
Lid on the Water Reservoir unless
you are refilling it.
18. This appliance is equipped with a
Power Cord having a grounding
wire with a grounding plug.
The appliance must be grounded
using a 3-hole properly grounded
outlet. In the event of an electrical
short circuit, grounding reduces
the risk of electrical shock.
19. If the outlet is a standard 2-prong
wall outlet, it is your personal
responsibility and obligation to
have it replaced with a properly
grounded 3-prong wall outlet.
20. Do not, under any circumstances,
cut or remove the third (ground)
prong from the Power Cord or use
an adapter.
21. Consult a qualified electrician if
the grounding instructions are not
completely understood, or
if doubt exists as to whether the
appliance is properly grounded.
22. Do not use the appliance for other
than its intended use.
