NOTE
BAIL REFORM AND RISK ASSESSMENT:
THE CAUTIONARY TALE OF FEDERAL SENTENCING
Across the country, from New Jersey to Texas to California, bail reform
is being debated, implemented, and litigated at the state and local
levels. Lawmakers and the public are learning that cash bail is excessive,
discriminatory, and costly for taxpayers and communities. With
promises to replace judicial instincts with validated algorithms and to
reserve detention for high-risk defendants, risk assessment tools have
become a hallmark of contemporary pretrial reform. Risk assessment
tools have proliferated despite substantial criticisms that the tools depend
upon and reinforce racially biased data and that the tools’ accuracy
is overblown or unknown. Part I of this Note examines contemporary
bail practices, recent reforms, and risk assessments’ promises and
shortcomings. Part II discusses federal sentencing reform, which originally
sought a more empirical approach to criminal justice but failed.
Part III applies the lesson of sentencing reform to bail reform today.
Despite endorsing empirical tools, legislatures are prone to interfering
with the evidence that informs those tools or with the tools themselves.
Even after reforms, system actors retain misaligned incentives to incarcerate
too many people. Technocratic instruments like risk assessments
may obscure but cannot answer tough, fundamental questions of system
design. But recent pretrial reforms have shown early signs of progress.
If risk assessments are paired with adequate safeguards, sustained reductions
in incarceration and progress toward equal treatment may be
possible.
I. BAIL REFORM NOW
Kalief Browder was a sixteen-year-old kid living with his family in
the Bronx when the police picked him up off the sidewalk and charged
him with robbery, grand larceny, and assault — for a crime he had not
committed.1 A judge set his bail at three thousand dollars, which was
more than his family could afford. So Browder was sent to Rikers
Island, New York City’s notorious and abusive jail,2 where he awaited
trial for three years.3 For at least two of those years, jail guards forced
him to live in solitary confinement. When not in solitary, he was often

beaten by guards and other inmates.4 Every now and then, the district
attorney’s office would offer him plea deals, including an offer that
would have let him leave jail that day for time served.5 But because he
was innocent, Browder refused to plead guilty.6 After imprisoning
Browder for three years, the Bronx District Attorney’s office dropped
the case, dismissing all charges against him.7 There was no trial.
Browder had missed years of high school and graduation.8 The trauma
of jail and solitary confinement haunted Browder; without a job or a
high school diploma, he found himself unable to adjust to regular life.
Two years after being released, Kalief Browder killed himself.9
Through news and social media,10 Browder’s tragic story and the
stories of others like him have brought renewed public attention to the
issue of bail and pretrial detention in our country. In the past year alone,
the editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and New
York Times have all written about the need to abolish cash bail.11 NBC
and Vice News have run special features on cash bail and opportunities
for reform.12
Bail practices vary, but most jurisdictions adhere to the following
methods13: After charges are filed against someone, a judge or magistrate
first determines whether to jail the person without the possibility
of release until the case is over.14 In most jurisdictions, a person may
be detained pretrial only if there is a high risk that the person will not
appear in court or that the person will be a danger to the community

before trial.15 The Supreme Court has cautioned that “[i]n our society,
liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the
carefully limited exception.”16
A judge can then decide to release the person if they promise to return
to court (release on personal recognizance), conditionally release the
person, or release the person on bail.17 With conditional release, a person
must fulfill conditions such as checking in with pretrial services,
drug testing, or electronic monitoring.18 With bail, a person can be released
on a secured or unsecured bond. For an unsecured bond, the
defendant doesn’t have to pay anything up front but will owe the court
money if they miss upcoming court dates.19
“Cash bail” or “money bail” almost always refers to secured bonds.20
For a secured bond, the defendant will be released from jail only upon
paying the bond amount to the court. Many jurisdictions assign a defendant
a predetermined bond amount based on the criminal charge,
without an assessment of the defendant’s ability to pay.21 Bail bondsmen
will charge the defendant a fee, often 10% of the bail amount, to
pay the bond on the defendant’s behalf.22 When the defendant arrives
at a later court date, the court will return the money to the bail bondsman,
who retains the defendant’s fee as profit. If someone is unable to
pay for bail or unable to pay a bail bondsman’s fee, the state will jail
them until their case is over or the bond is paid.23
Cash bail results in excessive detention, wealth- and race-based discrimination,
and high costs to taxpayers and communities. Nearly twothirds
of the people in jails in the United States have not been convicted
of a crime.24 On any given day, that’s more than 450,000 people,25 many
of whom don’t need to remain in jail: a judge has already determined
that they are not a flight or dangerousness risk. If they could pay their
bail or bail bondsman’s fee, they could walk out the front door and go
home. The pretrial imprisonment rate in the United States is among the
highest in the world — more than four times the world’s median pretrial

imprisonment rate.26 With just over 4% of the world’s population, the
United States has almost 20% of the world’s pretrial jail population.27
Jail populations have steadily increased in recent decades, largely because
more people are being incarcerated pretrial.28 A generation ago,
most people awaiting trial for a felony charge were released on their
own personal recognizance, but now similarly situated people are released
only if they can afford bail.29 People jailed pretrial are disproportionately
black and Hispanic,30 and one study has found that “Hispanic
and black defendants are more likely to be detained [pretrial] than
similarly situated white defendants.”31
With staggering incarceration numbers come staggering costs — for
the public and for those who are detained, their families, and their communities.
Taxpayers spend approximately $38 million a day — or $14
billion a year — on pretrial detention.32 Those who are detained face a
cascading avalanche of difficulties. They can lose their jobs because
they cannot go to work; without work and trapped in jail, they can lose
their homes because they cannot pay rent; separated from their families
and unable to support them, they can lose custody of their children or
leave an elderly or sick family member without a caregiver.33 As the
Supreme Court has observed, someone detained pretrial “is hindered in
his ability to gather evidence, contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare
his defense.”34 Innocent people sometimes accept plea offers because
pleading guilty allows them to go home, whereas maintaining their innocence
would require staying in jail for months or years awaiting
trial.35 Suicide remains the leading cause of death in American jails.36

And those are just the most visible problems. Empirical studies are
beginning to confirm what many have long suspected: Pretrial detention
results in worse case outcomes and has a criminogenic effect on people
— that is, detaining someone pretrial makes that person more likely
to commit a crime in the future.37 One study found that people who
were detained pretrial were more likely to be sentenced to jail or prison
than similarly situated people who were released before trial.38 People
detained pretrial are also more likely to face longer sentences.39 Even
brief stays in jail increase someone’s likelihood of committing crimes in
the future.40 And those who spend more than twenty-four hours in jail
but are released pretrial are less likely to make their court dates than
those who spend less time in jail.41
High-profile lawsuits and court decisions from across the country are
challenging contemporary bail practices. The Chief Judge of Cook
County, Illinois issued an order forbidding judges from setting bail beyond
what a defendant can afford to pay.42 The Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court recently held that judges must “consider a defendant’s
financial resources” before setting bail.43 Last spring, a federal judge
granted a preliminary injunction to plaintiffs who had sued Harris
County, Texas over its money bail practices.44 And a federal judge enjoined
money bail practices for those accused of misdemeanors in
Calhoun, Georgia.45 The Justice Department under President Obama
adopted the position that it is unconstitutional to hold people in jail
pretrial because they can’t afford bail.46 And the American Bar
Association now officially supports money bail reform.47

1130 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:1125
The rise of bail reform activism and legislation has been sudden and
meteoric. Nonprofits are funding efforts to eliminate money bail in at
least thirty-six states.48 In 2017, New Jersey replaced money bail with
a risk assessment system.49 Colorado and Kentucky have revised their
pretrial laws to discourage the use of money bail and adopt risk assessment
tools.50 Los Angeles County is considering pretrial reform, but the
California state government might pass statewide bail reform legislation
first.51 Bail reform also enjoys bipartisan support. Last summer, Democratic
Senator Kamala Harris and Republican Senator Rand Paul together
introduced legislation that would provide federal funding to
states to create policies reforming money bail.52
A pretrial system without money bail is not a utopian fantasy. For
decades Washington, D.C. has operated an effective pretrial system with
almost no money bail.53 D.C. releases 94% of defendants pretrial,54 90%
of whom make their court appointments, and 98% of whom are not
rearrested for a violent crime pretrial.55 These appearance and publicsafety
numbers are both higher than the national average.56
Some reform advocates champion the adoption of pretrial risk
assessment tools that use algorithms to predict a defendant’s risk of
dangerousness and flight. According to one developer of a risk
assessment tool, adopting a system “in which judges have access to
scientific, objective risk assessment tools could further our central goals
of increasing public safety, reducing crime, and making the most
effective, fair, and efficient use of public resources.”57 Other models for

switching from secured to unsecured bonds.59
Pretrial risk assessment tools typically use actuarial data to predict
how likely it is that someone will miss an upcoming court date or commit
a crime before trial.60 These tools use a checklist of risk factors that
statistically correlate with nonappearance in court or commission of a
crime pretrial.61 For example, New Jersey teamed up with the Laura
and John Arnold Foundation, which has created one of the most popular
risk assessment tools: the Public Safety Assessment (PSA).62 The PSA
looks to nine risk factors: age at current arrest, current violent offense,
pending charges, prior misdemeanor conviction, prior felony conviction,
prior violent conviction, prior failure to appear in past two years, prior
failure to appear older than two years, and prior sentence to incarceration.63
Based on a combination of these factors, a person receives three
prediction scores: a “failure to appear” score, a “new criminal activity”
score, and a “new violent criminal activity” score. For example, with
the “new criminal activity” score, a defendant could get two points for
being younger than twenty-two and one point for having missed a court
date during the last two years.64 Those numbers would be added up
into a raw score that would determine the person’s placement on a sixpoint
scale from low to high risk.65

1132 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:1125
Based on actuarial data, the PSA would predict that those who fall
in the first bar on the new-criminal-activity scale have a 14% chance of
committing an offense pretrial. At the other end, people who fall into
bar six have an estimated 50% chance of a committing a pretrial offense.66
The data from the risk assessment tools do not directly specify
whether someone should be detained pretrial. Policymakers must independently
decide the threshold level of risk that would require pretrial
detention.
There are substantial criticisms of risk assessment tools. Risk assessments
depend upon criminal justice data that is neither neutral nor objective.
American criminal justice has been shaped by our country’s
legacy of slavery and racial discrimination, by decades of mass incarceration,
by preventative policing and profiling that targets minority communities,
by a gulf between those who vote on criminal justice and those
who are affected by it, and by the explicit and implicit biases of people
working in the system.67 Former Attorney General Eric Holder has
shared concerns that risk assessments will result in greater racial disparities,68
and Professor Bernard Harcourt predicts that actuarial methods
will exacerbate racial and class biases.69 Professor Sonja Starr contends
that actuarial tools dependent on “demographic, socioeconomic,
family, and neighborhood variables” are unconstitutional, unwise, and
inaccurate.70 Risk assessment tools may also be deficient because the
data that inform the tools come from an environment where the only
pretrial options are jail and personal recognizance. For example, the
prediction that someone will miss a court date doesn’t consider how a
text message reminder or bus pass from pretrial services could improve
their chances of getting to court.71
Proponents of pretrial risk assessment tools argue that even though
the algorithms cannot fully shed the race or class bias inherent in the
data, they are a net improvement over the current system in which

judges’ and prosecutors’ biases are opaque and unknown.72 To minimize
bias, the creators of tools like the PSA have chosen not to use demographic
or socioeconomic data and have tried to calibrate the algorithms’
use of criminal histories to reduce racial disparities.73 There has
been little empirical research to see how these tools perform in practice,
and more research is needed.74 It’s also unsettled whether algorithms
will produce more transparency than the black box of a judge’s mind.
The aura and complexity of big data pose the risk of concealing racial
biases. The notions of objective data and computer algorithms can give
false assurances of neutrality.
Whether or not risk assessment tools are accurate or fair, they will
not be a panacea for pretrial injustice because the injustices of our current
pretrial system extend far beyond inaccurate predictions of defen
dants’ future behavior. To highlight a few examples: 46% of pretrial
defendants in New York City “end up going to jail for up to a week
because they cannot pay in the narrow window of time between their
arraignment and when the next bus [to jail on Rikers Island] leaves.”75
Pregnant women incarcerated pretrial are often forced to endure labor
while shackled to a bed and are separated from their babies within a
day or two of giving birth.76 Women detained pretrial in Muskegon
County, Michigan, have been routinely denied feminine hygiene products
and forced to strip naked in front of male guards in order to shower
or use the toilet.77 In litigation against Harris County, Texas’s bail practices,
county lawyers defended the practice of imprisoning people pretrial
on misdemeanor charges by claiming that people in county jail
want to be there, especially when it’s cold outside. The federal judge in
charge of the case found the argument “uncomfortably reminiscent of
the historical argument that used to be made that people enjoyed slavery.”78
Accurate predictions of pretrial risk are better than inaccurate
ones, but even if accurate predictions are acheivable, they can only be
one part in meaningful reform.

1134 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:1125
For better or worse, risk assessment tools are a central part of ongoing
and contemplated reforms across the country. Independent of risk
assessment’s limitations, errors, and biases, safeguards are needed to
prevent manipulation of these tools toward carceral and unequal ends.
II. LESSONS FROM SENTENCING REFORM
Federal sentencing reform can be a useful lens for viewing contemporary
bail reform efforts. Indeed, this Note is not the first bail scholarship
to mine sentencing reform as an analogical resource. Professor
Samuel Wiseman has similarly found that “the history of the sentencing
reform movement reflects many of the challenges of the current bail
system.”79 Like bail reform today, federal sentencing reform in the late
1980s and early 1990s enjoyed bipartisan support. There was general
agreement that the system was broken, that judges were making unprincipled
decisions that resulted in unfair outcomes, and that a more
empirical, data-driven approach might be the answer. Although federal
sentencing reform did not pursue the decarceral goal of modern criminal
justice reform efforts, sentencing reform endorsed a data-driven, smarton-crime
strategy. Like modern bail reform efforts, federal sentencing
reform involved the legislature upending an existing judicial practice
and conferring expert authority on an independent agency — all in the
hope of curbing abuses and ensuring more equal outcomes.
By the mid-1980s, practitioners and academics were in agreement
that federal sentencing was broken and that guidelines might help.80
Three problems seemed to plague federal sentencing. First, there were
wide sentencing disparities. Federal sentences varied from judge to
judge and from one region of the country to another. Quasiexperimental
studies revealed that, given the exact same fact pattern
and sentencing law, judges within the same federal circuit would arrive
at grossly divergent sentences.81 Second, federal sentencing had no consistent
goals or underlying philosophy. Each federal judge employed
their own theory of punishment — deterrence, retribution, incapacitation,
rehabilitation, or some unknown combination of each.82 Third,
prison sentences were indeterminate. Most sentences that judges imposed
from the bench were open-ended and subject to review by a parole
board.83

Congress sought to remedy these problems through the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984,
84 which established the Sentencing Commission
and gave it the task of creating sentencing guidelines.85 These guidelines
were intended to limit sentencing disparities and to ensure that sentences
would “adhere to a consistent sentencing philosophy.”86 Congress
also wanted sentencing judges to have an easy rubric for determining
an appropriate sentence.87 The judge would tally up numbers associated
with characteristics of the offense and characteristics of the offender
and use a grid that would specify a sentencing range. This sentencing
range would conform with the sentencing goals for the
particular type of offense and particular type of offender.88 From the
onset, the guidelines were to be informed by the Commission’s ongoing
research in order to “develop means of measuring the degree to which
the sentencing, penal, and correctional practices are effective in meeting
the purposes of sentencing.”89
Since the mid-1990s, “[f]ew outside the federal commission would
disagree that the federal guidelines have been a disaster.”90 Two central
problems have plagued the guidelines. First, federal sentencing failed
as an expert, evidence-based endeavor. Almost from the get-go,
Congress began to override the evidence-based reform goals of the
guidelines by imposing congressionally determined guideline ranges and
mandatory minimum sentences. Second, federal prosecutors have had
too much power and leverage — both in individual cases and with sway
over Congress — and have had no oversight and too few checks on that
power.
As one commentator succinctly put it, Congress “overrode the Guidelines,
distorted their development, and ultimately betrayed sentencing
reform.”91 Congress distorted federal sentencing through an ad hoc
hodgepodge of sentencing statutes that failed to conform with a consistent
sentencing or punishment goal. “Congress is of two minds on
sentencing reform. One mind [relying on the Sentencing Commission]
is dispassionate and learned, deliberating for decades in search of a ra–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

tional, comprehensive solution. The other [imposing mandatory minimums
and sentencing ranges] is impulsive, reckless, driven by unquenchable
political passions.”92
For example, with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 198693 (ADAA),
Congress introduced mandatory minimums and disparate sentences for
crack and powder cocaine.94 The new law punished someone possessing
one gram of crack cocaine the same as someone possessing one hundred
grams of powder cocaine — without providing a rationale for the 100-
to-1 ratio.95 Rather than being empirically precise, “[t]he ADAA was
passed in the midst of public paranoia and outcry over the crack epidemic
and the fear of AIDS being spread through drug use.”96 Because
mandatory minimums and sentencing ranges are imposed as statutes by
Congress, the Sentencing Commission is unable to change the sentences
when evidence suggests that change is needed.97 For decades, the
Sentencing Commission reported that the sentencing disparity was not
justified and led “to anomalous results in which retail crack dealers g[ot]
longer sentences than the wholesale drug distributors who suppl[ied]
them the powder cocaine from which their crack [wa]s produced.”98
More than 80% of people who received the heightened crack cocaine
sentences were African American, even though most crack users were
white or Hispanic.99
In part, mandatory minimums were able to take hold because the
Sentencing Commission could not agree upon sentencing goals. Among
deterrence, just deserts, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, the Commission
chose all of them and none of them.100 Rather than ensuring that
a given sentence conformed with any underlying goal or bargained-for

compromise between goals, the Sentencing Commission based the guideline
ranges on the historical averages of sentences across the country —
providing a statistically normative answer to a philosophically normative
question.101 As one commentator described the Commission’s approach,
“since people disagree over the aims of sentencing, it is best to
have no rationale at all.”102
As much as Congress was eager to meddle with the Sentencing
Commission’s process, the Department of Justice was eager to take advantage
of that meddling. “The failures of the guidelines can be traced
to the breakdown of the institutional balance the Sentencing Reform
Act was supposed to create. Power has consolidated in the hands of
prosecutors at the case level and an alliance of the Department of Justice
with Congress at the policy level.”103 Instead of letting the Sentencing
Commission remain insulated from political pressures and free to base
its decisions upon empirical research, the Department of Justice used its
influence over Congress to threaten to circumvent the Commission with
more legislatively enacted mandatory minimums.104 The Commission
followed the direction of the Executive and Congress, approving harsher
punishments that gave prosecutors at the case level more leverage over
defendants.105
At the case level, mandatory minimums and sentencing guidelines
meant a loss of judicial discretion, which led to increased prosecutorial
power. If a prosecutor convicted a defendant of a crime with a
mandatory minimum sentence, a judge’s hands were tied at sentencing,
no matter the severity of the federal penalty or the power of the
mitigating circumstances. Federal prosecutors used this to their
bargaining advantage. By threatening to prosecute someone with a
litany of charges that carried mandatory minimums, prosecutors could
more easily secure plea bargains.106 In the pre-Guidelines days, a
defendant might have chanced it by going to trial. After all, even if the
prosecutor won on all counts, the sentencing judge might not share the
prosecutor’s bloodlust. But with mandatory minimums, the risk of trial
carried greater and more certain costs.

III. APPLYING THE LESSON
The history of sentencing reform warns that technocratic criminal
justice reform can be vulnerable on nearly all fronts. Powerful system
actors can hijack tools of reform toward their own economic, structural,
and racial ends. In the face of political pressure and media attention,
the same legislature that passes reform can waver in its commitment to
evidence-based practices and undermine the project. And without buyin,
aligned incentives, and limits on discretion, prosecutors and judges
can manipulate technocratic reform. Technocratic tools can be useful,
but they cannot answer tough normative questions at the heart of criminal
justice.
A. The Siren Song of Punishment
Unless restrained, legislatures and agencies can undermine their own
technocratic reform efforts, especially under the influence of the prosecutor
lobby.107 This manipulation is already afoot in pretrial reform.
Just as fears of a crack epidemic swept in the mandatory minimums that
would define the sentencing guidelines,108 fears of violence from people
released pretrial have begun to disrupt New Jersey’s risk assessment
tools.109 After New Jersey adopted pretrial reform last year, a handful
of people facing gun charges committed violent crimes after being released
pretrial. One man allegedly murdered someone a few days after
his release.110 Another man killed his ex-girlfriend and himself.111 In
response, the state Attorney General’s office asked the Judiciary
Committee to modify the inputs of the risk assessment tool in order to
increase the dangerousness prediction for people charged with gun possession,
and asked for those charges to automatically trigger a recommendation
against release.112 The ACLU and New Jersey Public
Defender’s office opposed the change, contending that any changes
would be based on anecdotes, not empirical data.113 The Judiciary

or a sense of increased crime. Rakesh N. Kilaru, Comment, Guidelines as Guidelines: Lessons from

2018] BAIL REFORM AND RISK ASSESSMENT 1139
Committee largely acquiesced to the Attorney General’s request and
made certain gun charges automatically trigger a presumption of detention,
regardless of the risk assessment tool’s prediction.114 Ironically,
just a few years ago the poster child for the injustice of the New Jersey
bail system was a man who had been detained pretrial on — you guessed
it — a gun possession charge. Because he could not afford $50,000 bail,
Mustafa Willis lost his job and spent months in jail, only for prosecutors
to drop the charges against him.115 In 2014, Willis testified about his
experience before the state senate’s Law and Public Safety Committee
when the Committee first considered bail reform.116
Colorado has displayed similar tendencies. The state legislature has
passed provisions that allow courts to bypass risk assessment tools and
deny the possibility of release for people facing certain weaponpossession
and sexual-assault charges.117
The problem is not that legislatures or judicial committees are acting
ultra vires when they meddle with or bypass risk assessment tools. On
the contrary, the legislature has the legal authority to obliterate
evidence-based practices altogether. But if a legislature commits to
evidence-based tools, those evidence-based tools should remain
grounded in evidence. Although Willie Horton media maelstroms can
capture the attention of the public, evidence-based tools should be
swayed by the totality of the data, not by moment-to-moment public
and legislative whims.
If New Jersey’s manipulation of risk assessment tools ends with
increased detention for gun charges, then the state will retain a
predominantly evidence-based system. But so long as some people are
free before their trials, some of those people will commit crimes, and
some of those crimes will be noteworthy. Just as a few noteworthy
crimes gave support to manipulating the assessment tool for gun
charges, new noteworthy crimes will support manipulating the process
for other charges.
To resist the siren song of one high-profile incident after another,
legislatures should mimic Ulysses and tie themselves to the mast. When
adopting bail reform legislation, legislatures should precommit to procedures
and evidence-based justifications for modifying the risk assessment
tools and pretrial recommendations. The inputs for the risk assessment
tools should only allow for modification through aggregated
evidence and analysis. And legislatures should make it difficult for
themselves or the agencies they create to introduce any provisions that

bypass the risk assessment tools. With these safeguards in place, legislative
bodies can commit themselves to an evidence-based practice and
prevent themselves from tampering with the evidence.
B. Misaligned Incentives
Just as federal prosecutors took advantage of mandatory minimums
and sentencing guidelines to increase their leverage over defendants, impose
harsher sentences, and fill federal prisons, local prosecutors and
judges can be expected to take advantage of loopholes in pretrial procedures
or quirks in the risk assessment tools. Even after pretrial reforms,
judges and prosecutors retain the incentive to be too cautious releasing
people pretrial because some released people will commit new crimes
that will bring public scrutiny upon the judge or district attorney. An
elected judge’s photo will show up in the newspaper when someone released
pretrial commits a crime, but the newspapers won’t publish the
judge’s photo when people released pretrial maintain their jobs, pay
their rent, and keep their families intact.118 Judges and prosecutors —
especially elected judges and prosecutors — have a stronger incentive to
appear reform-minded than to follow through with reform. In recent
years, many district attorneys have been elected with campaign rhetoric
championing reform only to retreat to familiar practices once in office.119
In the bail reform context, Wiseman has previously identified this disconnect
between legislative reform and judicial action as a “principalagent”
problem.120 More colloquially, it’s a “covering your ass” problem.
In many jurisdictions that have adopted pretrial risk assessment
tools, a defendant’s risk score creates a presumption for detention or a
presumption against detention, but judges are not bound by the recommendation.
Judges haven’t been particularly constrained to date. A
Chicago Sun Times report found that judges in Cook County depart
from risk assessment recommendations 85% of the time.121 In forthcoming
empirical research on Kentucky judges’ practices after bail reform,
Professor Megan Stevenson observes, “[i]f judges followed the recommendations
associated with the risk assessment, 90% of defendants
would be granted immediate non-financial release. In practice, only
29% are released on non-monetary bond at the first bail-setting.”122 We

should be wary of reading too much significance into short-term trends
of judges following risk assessment recommendations and detaining
fewer people, because, at least in Kentucky, those trends have diminished
over time as judges return to familiar habits.123
In states that adopt pretrial reforms, prosecutors and judges may
also be able to take advantage of loopholes in the law. In New Jersey,
there is a catch-all provision in the bail reform statute that allows a
prosecutor to bypass the risk assessment recommendation and move for
detention if the prosecutor “believes there is a serious risk that” the defendant
will not show up to court or is too dangerous to be released.124
New Jersey also has a catch-all provision that allows judges to impose
additional conditions of release beyond what the risk assessment tool
recommends.125 While not as severe as detention, excessive conditions
of release can substantially restrict someone’s liberty and can potentially
violate someone’s constitutional rights. For example, the release conditions
of house arrest and wearing an electronic ankle monitor can foreclose
job and education opportunities.126
Just as federal prosecutors used the threat of mandatory minimums
for plea bargaining leverage, local prosecutors can be overly punitive
pretrial by overcharging. To successfully overcharge at the pretrial
stage, prosecutors must meet the low threshold of probable cause for the
charges filed.127 Often this involves reading a police report in the worst
light possible for the defendant. For example, if a defendant is accused
of kicking someone, then the district attorney can charge the kicker with
assault, assault and battery, and assault and battery with a dangerous
weapon (so long as the kicker was wearing a shoe).128 When bargaining
for a plea, a prosecutor’s overcharging sensibilities are tempered by the
range of likely trial outcomes. To convict the kicker of assault and battery
with a dangerous weapon at trial, a prosecutor would have to convince
a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the shoe was a dangerous
weapon. If the prosecutor overplays their hand when plea bargaining,
the defense can call their bluff and go to trial. But at the pretrial stage,
prosecutors can overcharge with impunity because probable cause is a
low burden of proof, and prosecutors are free to amend or drop the
charges later.129 For example, with New Jersey’s pretrial risk assessment
tool, the current charge is one of the factors that determines

whether a defendant is flagged as high risk for committing a violent
crime on release.130 If the charge is a violent one and the defendant is
flagged, then the defendant will presumptively be incarcerated pretrial
— regardless of the numbered score on the defendant’s risk assessment.
Even if this defendant is released, this flag results in more onerous
pretrial conditions for the defendant.131
Some safeguards could help mitigate judges’ and prosecutors’ inclination
or ability to take advantage of pretrial tools. The swell of support
for criminal justice reform — and bail reform in particular — may
change how judges and prosecutors relate to the electorate. Other safeguards
include limiting the ability to depart from a risk assessment recommendation
to release a defendant or making those departures more
procedurally costly.
Elections matter. To maintain public confidence, judges and prosecutors
overincarcerate because the public pays attention to mistaken leniency
and not mistaken detention. But in some places that’s starting
to change. Every candidate in Brooklyn’s district attorney Democratic
primary ran on a platform supporting bail reform.132 After civil rights
groups sued Harris County, Texas, for its cash bail practices, the newly
elected sheriff and district attorney abandoned their predecessors’ support
of bail and have sided with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.133 The
Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and a Court of Criminal
Appeals Judge have both come out in support of pretrial reform in
Texas.134 Larry Krasner, the recently elected District Attorney in Philadelphia,
has promised to reform cash bail.135 If the public votes for

2018] BAIL REFORM AND RISK ASSESSMENT 1143
pretrial leniency and continues to pay attention, judges and prosecutors
are more likely to listen.
States could also restrict departures from the risk assessment recommendations
to release a defendant or make those departures more procedurally
costly.136 Time is a great discipliner of overburdened attorneys
and judges. In some states that have adopted bail reform, judges must
specify their reasons for departing from the risk assessment tool’s recommendation
— often on the record and in writing.137 But the judge’s
decision is often only reviewed on appeal under an abuse of discretion
standard,138 resulting in reversal only if the detention decision “‘rest[s]
on an impermissible basis’ or was ‘based upon a consideration of irrelevant
or inappropriate factors.’”139 Alternatively, states could require
that a judge’s decision or prosecutor’s motion to depart from the risk
assessment tool’s recommendation be made in writing and also be
grounded in factors different than those that the risk assessment tool
considers.140 And rather than subject these decisions to protracted appellate
court review under an abuse of discretion standard, detention
decisions could be subject to an accelerated or mandatory appeal under
a more exacting standard. Wiseman has proposed the more radical solution
of imposing mandatory bail guidelines on judges.141 The story of
federal sentencing teaches us that removing judicial discretion only
shifts that discretion elsewhere, for better or worse. But Wiseman’s proposal
has some promise because, rather than shifting discretion to prosecutors
who have similarly misaligned incentives, mandatory guidelines
would largely shift discretion to the politically insulated agency that
oversees the risk assessment tool.
C. Technocratic Limits
Technocracy can obscure but cannot answer important normative
questions at the heart of pretrial justice. For sentencing reform, an indeterminate
philosophy meant that there was no metric by which to
measure whether the guidelines were achieving their intended results.
Guidelines were supposed to resolve the competing goals of sentencing,
but the Sentencing Commission was unable to arrive at a satisfactory
compromise. There was no consensus over whether deterrence, retribution,
incapacitation, or rehabilitation was paramount and no formula
for balancing some combination of these philosophies.

Pretrial reform also suffers from an indeterminate goal. There is
broad consensus that better data should lead to better pretrial decisionmaking.
As New Jersey’s former Attorney General said in her TED
talk about bail reform, “I wanted to moneyball criminal justice,”142 referencing
a book that chronicled the Oakland Athletics’ use of data and
statistics to succeed in Major League Baseball.143 But unlike bail or
sentencing reform, the Oakland Athletics had one undivided goal: to
win baseball games.
Pretrial justice and pretrial reform have competing goals that are not
easily reconciled: preserving the presumption of innocence for people
charged with crimes, imposing the least restrictive conditions on release,
protecting the public from people charged with crimes, ensuring that
people return to court, imposing detention in a racially and economically
fair way, and reducing America’s astounding pretrial incarceration rate.
A fleeting Twitter exchange between bail-reform advocates encapsulates
this conflict. Danny Montes is the Alliances Director for Californians
for Safety and Justice. He tweeted out a message in support of
California bail reform, “Why Californians Need #BailReform ‘If someone
can afford their bail even though they are a threat to public safety,
they’re free to go. Our bail system should prioritize public safety, not
wealth.’”144 His tweet was met with two replies from New York Legal
Aid’s Decarceration Project, “Sorry, you have it backwards. Our bail
system should prioritize release and decarceration above all else”145 and
“Here’s a ?-Who gets to decide who is a ‘public safety risk’? Could that
be anymore ambiguous? Jeff Sessions thinks it’s smoking weed.”146
Tina Luongo from Legal Aid also replied, “pre-trial bail system should
remember that EVERYONE is Presumed Innocent. Assessment of who
could potentially be dangerous is dangerous.”147
Technocratic tools can only do so much to achieve all of pretrial reform’s
goals without tradeoffs. Given that bail is a suboptimal tool for
achieving any pretrial goals, there should be some opportunity for improvements
that reduce crime, reduce missed court dates, and increase

2018] BAIL REFORM AND RISK ASSESSMENT 1145
release.148 But the capacity for simultaneous improvements is limited.
As recent empirical research indicates, at a certain point, efforts to protect
the public through risk-based incarceration will come at the expense
of efforts to decarcerate or preserve the presumption of innocence.149
The opposite is also true: efforts to decarcerate or preserve the presumption
of innocence will counteract efforts to maximize public safety.
Risk assessment tools cannot answer a normative question at the
heart of contemporary pretrial justice: to imprison someone for their
future behavior, how certain must we be that the person will commit a
crime or not appear in court?
The risk threshold is the most important part of risk assessment tools
because it marks the compromise between the presumption of innocence,
decarceration, and public safety.150 With the sentencing guidelines,
the philosophical impasse made room for an even larger problem:
Congress’s vote of no confidence in the Commission and its imposition
of mandatory minimums. Because there was no purpose, goal, or bargained-for
compromise behind the sentencing guidelines’ length, legislative
interference could not contradict the guidelines’ underlying goals.
Within risk assessment-based bail reform, unless stakeholders bargain
for and commit to a risk threshold that balances public safety, the presumption
of innocence, and decarceration, subsequent changes to the
threshold will not violate an underlying commitment. Even if risk assessment
tools initially result in lower jail populations, the longterm stability
of this reduction depends upon the risk threshold remaining
constant.
The agency or judiciary committee responsible for committing to a
certain threshold should seek input from stakeholders and be transparent
about the balance it strikes between competing pretrial values. New
scholarship has begun to explore just how jurisdictions might practically
reconcile competing pretrial goals and choose optimal risk levels.151 Until
now, discussions of bail reform have been too vocal about the promise
of data and too quiet about risk assessment’s attendant risk-threshold
compromises. This silence risks mimicking the sentencing guidelines’
approach that “since people disagree over the aims . . . it is best to have
no rationale at all.”152

1146 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:1125
CONCLUSION
If bail reform can learn from the history of the sentencing guidelines,
new efforts at pretrial reform may find lasting success. If reformers are
willing to pragmatically concede that pretrial detention based on dangerousness
can overwhelm the presumption of innocence, then they
should make sure that the game is worth the candle. Risk assessment
tools do not alone ensure that our pretrial systems will move closer to
decarceration and equality.153 Risk assessment tools are just that: tools.
The tools can be wielded for justice or injustice. Jurisdictions without
a commitment to equality and decarceration could use risk assessment
tools and set the risk thresholds at levels that allow detention levels to
remain constant or rise. Intentionally or not, these places could protect
overincarceration and inequality behind the rhetoric of algorithms and
big data. A bail-reform nightmare could come true: the same unequal,
overly punitive system would hum along smoothly, but the political capital
for reform would have been spent, and the injustice would be hidden
behind a mask of evidence-based neutrality.
The history of sentencing reform teaches us that data-driven reform
is susceptible to meddling from the legislature and manipulation by
judges and prosecutors. Without adequate safeguards in place, some
jurisdictions may adopt risk assessment tools only to conceal and preserve
our current system’s inequality and cruelty. Committing to a fixed
public safety threshold, entrenching the evidence-based processes from
outside interference, and tempering the misaligned incentives of judges
and prosecutors are all indications that a jurisdiction can work toward
a more equal, less punitive pretrial system.
