ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS?
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF TRADEMARK DEPLETION
AND CONGESTION

American trademark law has long operated on the assumption that there exists an
inexhaustible supply of unclaimed trademarks that are at least as competitively effective
as those already claimed. This core empirical assumption underpins nearly every aspect
of trademark law and policy. This Article presents empirical evidence showing that this
conventional wisdom is wrong. The supply of competitively effective trademarks is, in fact,
exhaustible and has already reached severe levels of what we term trademark depletion
and trademark congestion. We systematically study all 6.7 million trademark applications
filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) from 1985 through 2016 together
with the 300,000 trademarks already registered at the PTO as of 1985. We analyze these
data in light of the most frequently used words and syllables in American English, the
most frequently occurring surnames in the United States, and an original dataset
consisting of phonetic representations of each applied-for or registered word mark included
in the PTO’s Trademark Case Files Dataset. We further incorporate data consisting of all
128 million domain names registered in the .com top-level domain and an original dataset
of all 2.1 million trademark office actions issued by the PTO from 2003 through 2016.
These data show that rates of word-mark depletion and congestion are increasing and have
reached chronic levels, particularly in certain important economic sectors. The data
further show that new trademark applicants are increasingly being forced to resort to
second-best, less competitively effective marks. Yet registration refusal rates continue to

rise. The result is that the ecology of the trademark system is breaking down, with
mounting barriers to entry, increasing consumer search costs, and an eroding public
domain. In light of our empirical findings, we propose a mix of reforms to trademark law
that will help to preserve the proper functioning of the trademark system and further its
core purposes of promoting competition and enhancing consumer welfare.
INTRODUCTION
American trademark law has long operated on the assumption that
there exists an inexhaustible supply of unclaimed trademarks that
are at least as competitively effective as those already claimed. With
respect to word marks in particular, the conventional wisdom holds that
we will always enjoy a surplus of preexisting words, and in any case
trademark adopters can simply coin new words, the supply of which is
thought to be effectively “infinite.”1 This empirical assumption — that
the supply of good, competitively effective trademarks is inexhaustible
— has long formed the foundation of important theoretical conjectures
at the core of trademark law and policy. The most significant of
these is that when we grant exclusive rights in a trademark, the cost to
competitors, consumers, and more generally to the public domain is inconsequential.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom in trademark law, however,
popular media has lately begun to make the opposite empirical claim:
that the supply of good trademarks is, in fact, exhaustible and that
we have very nearly exhausted it. For example, the New York Times
recently asserted that “[a]lmost every naturally occurring word has been
claimed, which is why namers so often arrive at portmanteaus
(Accenture derives from ‘accent’ and ‘future’) or drop vowels (Flickr
and Tumblr) or change letters (Lyft).”2 For its part, Bloomberg View
recently featured the headline “We’re Going to Run Out of Company

(discussing the widespread assumption that “the set of marks appropriate to a given product category
is practically infinite”); see also, e.g., William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, Trademark Law:
An Economic Perspective, 30 J.L. & ECON. 265, 274 (1987) (“[T]he distinctive yet pronounceable
combinations of letters to form words that will serve as a suitable trademark are as a practical
matter infinite, implying a high degree of substitutability and hence a slight value in exchange.”);

to find a name for his new company: “Every name we liked, either
somebody already had it or it wasn’t trademarkable or it meant something
pornographic in another language.”4 For the Chicago Tribune, the
focus was craft beer and the headline was “Craft Beer Makers Running
Out of Names. How About Flip Donkey Doodleplunk?”5 NPR has
further reported that “[v]irtually every large city, notable landscape feature,
creature and weather pattern of North America — as well as myriad
other words, concepts and images — has been snapped up and
trademarked as the name of either a brewery or a beer.”6 For The
Guardian, the focus was band names under the headline “FKA Twigs,
Slaves, Deers: Are We Running Out of Band Names?”7 The article observed
that “[a]ll the best monikers have been taken, and now the lawsuits
are flying.”8 Reports suggest that the cosmetics industry is facing
similar challenges: “The beauty industry has literally run out of names
to use for new product[s] . . . . Why, even the name ‘There Aren’t Anymore
Names for This’ is taken.”9 Popular television series have also
taken up the theme. Futurama and South Park have each featured

scenes in which nearly all words or word combinations have already
been trademarked.10
Meanwhile, free speech advocates have grown increasingly vocal
about the pervasive trademarking of everyday words. The YouTube
duo the Fine Brothers announced in 2016 that they had applied to register
the word “react,” after their series of videos.11 The public reaction
was critical and merciless. One commenter joked about registering the
word “the” and threatened that “anyone who says it get[s] sued.”12 The
commenter was no doubt unaware that at the time there were already
eleven active trademark registrations claiming just the word THE.13
Another commenter stated simply: “REACT is not yours to trademark.”14
And perhaps it wasn’t: there were already three active registrations
of the word in the particular class of services in which the Fine
Brothers applied and thirty-seven active registrations overall.15 In response
to the furor, the Fine Brothers withdrew their trademark application.16
To the extent that legal and popular commentary has engaged the
question of the exhaustibility of the supply of trademarks, the discussion
has been based at best on anecdata and at worst on raw assertion. This
Article seeks to move beyond both by systematically studying all 6.7
million trademark applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) from 1985 through 2016 together with the 300,000 trademarks
already registered at the PTO as of 1985, which is made possible
by the PTO’s recently released Trademark Case Files Dataset.17 We
analyze the PTO data along two dimensions, which we term “trademark
depletion” and “trademark congestion.” Trademark depletion is the process
by which a decreasing number of potential trademarks remain unclaimed
by any trademark owner.18 By contrast, trademark congestion

decreasing number of potential marks that are actually available for adoption as trademarks. See
infra section III.A, pp. 978–81 (analyzing word-mark depletion). Rather, as we use the term, depletion
refers to a decreasing number of potential marks that are unclaimed by any trademark owner.

is the process by which an already-claimed mark is claimed by an increasing
number of different trademark owners.19 This Article focuses
specifically on word marks and thus on word-mark depletion and wordmark
congestion. Overall, the data show that the conventional legal
wisdom is wrong and the conventional popular wisdom is right. The
supply of word marks that are at least reasonably competitively effective
as trademarks is finite and exhaustible. This supply is already severely
depleted, particularly in certain sectors of the economy, and levels of
depletion continue to rise. Those marks that are registered are growing
increasingly congested. The result, as the data reveal, is that new trademark
applicants are increasingly being forced to resort to second-best,
less competitive marks, and the trademark system is growing increasingly
— perhaps inordinately — crowded, noisy, and complex.
Specifically, the data present compelling evidence of substantial
word-mark depletion, particularly with respect to the sets of potential
marks that businesses prefer most: standard English words, short neologisms
that are pronounceable by English speakers, and common
American surnames. Together with the PTO dataset, we use the Corpus
of Contemporary American English dataset of the 100,000 most frequently
used words in American English and the U.S. Census’s list of
the 151,672 most frequently occurring surnames in the United States to
show the extraordinarily high proportion of English words and common
surnames that are already registered as trademarks. We further show
the remarkably low proportion of words and surnames not confusingly
similar to already-registered marks. With respect to short neologisms,
we use the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary and
LOGIOS Lexicon tool to construct a phonetic representation of each
word mark applied for or registered in the PTO dataset. Based on these
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
19 Importantly, the phenomena of trademark depletion and trademark congestion are different
from, though related to, the phenomenon of trademark “cluttering.” Cluttering refers to marks that
are registered but not used in commerce by their registrants in one or more of the classes in which
they are registered. See GEORG VON GRAEVENITZ ET AL., TRADE MARK CLUTTERING: AN
EXPLORATORY REPORT 5 (2012), https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/
attachment_data/file/312092/ipresearch-tmcluttering.pdf [https://perma.cc/BEW7-AP2R] (“[W]e define
cluttered trade mark registers as registers containing such a large number of unused or overly
broad trade marks, that the costs of creating and registering new marks substantially increase for
other applicants.” (footnote and emphases omitted)); id. at 5 n.2 (“Overly broad in this context means
seeking protection in more classes than are required.”). Cluttering is a significant problem for foreign
trademark systems that do not have as strict a use requirement as that imposed by American
trademark law. See id. at 9 (discussing the differences between use requirements in the United
States and European jurisdictions); see also Georg von Graevenitz, Trade Mark Cluttering —
Evidence from EU Enlargement, 65 OXFORD ECON. PAPERS 721, 722, 732 (2013) (using data provided
by the European Community Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (now called
the European Union Intellectual Property Office) to examine how European Union enlargement
drove pharmaceutical firms to further clutter the Community Trade Mark register with registrations
for marks they were unlikely to use). We address the problem of trademark clutter at the
PTO in section V.B, infra pp. 1029–41.
952 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
data, we show that the supply of short neologisms not confusingly similar
to already-registered marks is substantially declining. Finally, because
many trademark applicants prefer to be able to register any new
mark as a domain name in the .com top-level domain, we use Verisign’s
.COM Zone File consisting of some 128 million currently registered domain
names in the .com top-level domain to illustrate the near-total depletion
in that space of standard English words, common American surnames,
and short neologisms.
Given these conditions, new applicants are increasingly resorting to
suboptimal marks. The data indicate that applicants are applying less
often for standard English words and common surnames and more often
for more complex marks, as measured by character, syllable, and word
count. We think that applicants are modifying their conduct in this
manner primarily to avoid applying for marks that the PTO would refuse
to register on the basis of section 2(d) of the Lanham Act,20 which
denies the registration of a mark that, due to its similarity with an
already-registered mark, would confuse consumers as to source.21 Yet
applicants appear to be increasingly unsuccessful in avoiding such refusals.
We use our original dataset of all 2.1 million trademark office
actions issued by the PTO from 2003 through 2016 to report the increasing
rate at which the PTO is refusing applied-for marks on the basis of
section 2(d). Despite these trends, one class of applicants appears to be
doing fine. Incumbent applicants (those applying based on previous
registrations) continue to apply for non-neologisms at a rate substantially
higher than nonincumbent applicants and continue to enjoy very
low section 2(d) refusal rates.
The data also reveal compelling evidence of substantial word-mark
congestion. Consistent with increasing section 2(d) refusal rates, trademark
applicants are increasingly resorting to what we term “parallel
registrations.” Two firms can use exactly the same mark provided that
their uses would not confuse consumers as to source (for example,
DELTA for faucets and DELTA for airlines).22 Nevertheless, a trademark
owner would prefer to be at best the only firm in the economy

registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, or a mark or trade name previously used in the
United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with
the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive”). 22 We use the term “parallel registrations,” rather than “concurrent registrations,” to refer to this
phenomenon. Concurrent registrations are a subset of parallel registrations. Concurrent registrations
consist of registrations in which two or more different parties operating in different regions of
the country register the same mark for similar goods or services when each party’s use is sufficiently
geographically separate from each other party’s use that no confusion will result. See id.; see also
3 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION
§ 20:81, at 20-197 (4th ed. 2017). Concurrent registrations are exceptionally rare. The PTO data
indicate that for all 5.9 million Principal Register applications from 1985 through 2014, only 604
resulted in registrations subject to concurrent use. See infra Part II, pp. 973–77.
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 953
using a particular mark and at least the only firm in its economic sector
doing so. Parallel uses may not confuse consumers as to source, but
each use destroys the uniqueness and blurs the distinctiveness of the
other, particularly for newer entrants. They also increase consumer
search costs. Yet the data show steady increases in parallel registrations
of frequently used English words and common surnames both across
and within classes of goods and services. Firms appear to be increasingly
settling for sharing marks with others.
These findings urge a rethinking of many of the fundamental assumptions
underlying trademark law. Most importantly, they emphasize
that the granting of trademark rights imposes real costs on the ecology
of the trademark system, and that as we begin to test the limits of
this ecology, these costs are mounting. New market entrants face significant
barriers to entry in the form of the cost of searching for an unclaimed
mark and in the ongoing cost of using a less effective mark.
Consumers must cope with an ever more crowded field of trademarks
consisting of increasingly complex marks that may refer to multiple different
sources. The public domain must cope with the fact that, as we
report below, when we use our language, about three-fourths of the time
we are using a word that someone has claimed as a trademark.
These findings also counsel fundamental reforms of trademark law
and doctrine. For example, given the costs a trademark registration
imposes on the rest of the trademark system, particularly when the registration
consists of a desirable word like a standard English word, we
could enforce the use requirement more aggressively, as the PTO has
already begun to do. We could also elevate the required showing of
secondary meaning that an applicant must make when seeking to register
a descriptive mark. In general, we could institute various schemes
of congestion or peak pricing with respect to application, maintenance,
and renewal fees to compel registrants to internalize more of the costs
that their registrations impose on competitors, consumers, and the public
domain. We could also take the degree of trademark depletion and
congestion in particular sectors into account in the protectability, infringement,
and trademark fair use analyses. The challenge in all cases
will be to ensure that these reforms do not impose even greater costs on
entrants. To be sure, many of these reforms may strike current trademark
owners as unthinkable. But they are unthinkable only if we continue
to fall back on the conventional wisdom that the trademark system
is based on an inexhaustible resource, or in any case, that our economy
could never reach a stage of development that would begin to test the
limits of this resource. As we show, this conventional wisdom is wrong,
and we must begin to consider ways of adapting to the limits of the
trademark system.
Part I provides background on the trademark registration process
and addresses the question of how to define the universe of good trademarks.
Of course, the supply of possible trademarks, like the supply of
954 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
possible personal names, is theoretically infinite. At the extreme, new
firms could simply adopt alphanumeric codes of indefinite length to
identify themselves. We explain why this is the wrong way to think
about the universe of potential trademarks and why marketers rightly
see this universe in very different terms. Part II describes our datasets.
Parts III and IV present evidence of word-mark depletion and wordmark
congestion, respectively. Though we draw upon “big data,” our
evidence takes the form of straightforward descriptive statistics showing
clear trends over time. Part V sets out the implications of our findings
for trademark law and policy.
I. BACKGROUND
Trademark law protects brands, which almost always appear in the
form of words as brand names, but may also manifest in other indicia
of source including symbols, images, and sometimes a product’s
packaging or design.23 A properly functioning trademark system is
crucial to a fair and efficient marketplace.24 The theory underlying
trademark law is that producers will invest in product quality only if
they can benefit from the reputation-related rewards of that
investment.25 Trademarks enable producers to build goodwill, and
trademark protection prevents others from trading on that goodwill.26
Trademarks also allow consumers to quickly and assuredly find
the products they seek.27 A trademark serves as shorthand for the
complex of qualities of which a product consists, qualities that are often
difficult to discern before purchase or use28 — and sometimes even after
use, as with some pharmaceuticals.29 Trademarks reduce consumer
search costs — consumers’ costs of finding product characteristics of

interest — because consumers can search for the easily perceivable
trademark rather than a product’s often more elusive characteristics.30
Trademark law, then, benefits both consumers and producers. The
primary way it does so is by preventing any firm from using a trademark
that is so similar to another firm’s mark that consumers will be confused
as to the true source of one or both of the firms’ goods.
In this Part, we provide background on trademark law and in particular
on the trademark registration process. We also review both the
legal and marketing considerations that limit the universe of potential
trademarks.
A. The Trademark Registration Process
To qualify for registration at the PTO, a trademark must meet three
basic requirements. First, it must be “distinctive” of the source of the
goods or services with which it is used.31 Second, it must be used in
commerce.32 Third, it must not violate any of the Lanham Act’s various
statutory bars to protection.33 For our purposes, the most important bar
to registration is the section 2(d) bar against the registration of any mark
that is confusingly similar to an already-registered mark.34 As we show
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
30 Landes & Posner, supra note 1, at 269–70. 31 See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f) (2012). 32 See id. § 1051(a)(1) (providing for registration of a mark “used in commerce”); id. § 1051(d)
(providing for registration of a mark filed on an intent-to-use basis upon filing of a statement that
the mark is “used in commerce”). Certain foreign applications need not meet the use-in-commerce
requirement to receive registration. See id. § 1126(e) (providing for registration of a mark already
registered in certain foreign jurisdictions provided that the applicant has a bona fide intention to
use the mark in commerce in the United States, but specifying that “use in commerce shall not be
required prior to registration”); id. § 1141f(a) (providing for registration of a mark under the Madrid
Protocol system provided that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce
in the United States). Applications filed under § 1126(e) (so-called “Section 44(e) applications”) are
rare. The PTO data indicate that of the 385,249 Principal Register trademark applications filed in
2016, 5585 were filed on this basis. Applications filed under § 1141f(a) (so-called “Section 66(a)
applications”) are also rare. There were 15,374 such applications filed in 2016. See infra Part II,
pp. 973–77, for discussion of the Trademark Case Files Dataset. Regardless of the statutory basis
for their registration, all registrants must show that they are making a “use in commerce” in order
to pursue a claim of trademark infringement. See Rearden LLC v. Rearden Commerce, Inc., 683
F.3d 1190, 1203 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[A] party pursuing a trademark claim must meet a threshold ‘use
in commerce’ requirement.”). But see Belmora LLC v. Bayer Consumer Care AG, 819 F.3d 697,
706 (4th Cir. 2016) (holding that § 1125(a) “does not require that a plaintiff possess or have used a
trademark in U.S. commerce as an element of the cause of action”). 33 See 15 U.S.C. § 1052. 34 See infra section I.A.3, pp. 960–61 (elaborating on the requirements of section 2(d)). Our
dataset of all office actions issued by the PTO from 2003 through 2016 shows that other bars to
registration rarely form a ground for rejection. Of the 3,376,150 applications for registration on the
Principal Register filed from 2003 through 2014, only 0.08% were met with an office action refusing
registration on the ground that the mark was functional, 0.02% on the ground that the mark was
disparaging, and 0.06% on the ground that the mark was scandalous. See infra Part II, pp. 973–
77, for discussion of our PTO office action dataset. In Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), the
Supreme Court held that the Lanham Act’s disparagement bar to registration was unconstitutional
956 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
in Part III, a significant and increasing proportion of applications are
being refused on this ground.
A trademark need not take any particular form to qualify for registration.
The PTO has registered as trademarks words,35 phrases,36 twodimensional
images, both moving37 and still,38 three-dimensional
shapes39 including building exteriors,40 sounds,41 scents,42 textures,43
and even particular motions.44 Nevertheless, a very high proportion of
registered trademarks consist in whole or part of text. As of the end of
2016, there were 2,094,051 active trademark registrations on the PTO’s
Principal Register.45 Of these, 95.7% included text; 75.6% consisted only
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
under the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Id. at 1751. It is probable that the scandalousness
bar to registration will also be found to be unconstitutional. See Letter Brief of
Appellant Eric Brunetti at 1, In re Brunetti, No. 2015-1109 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 9, 2017), ECF No. 70
(“[T]here is no difference between the Disparagement Clause and the Scandalous Clause. . . . The
Disparagement Clause is unconstitutional [under Matal]. It follows that the Scandalous Clause is
unconstitutional.”). 35 See, e.g., AMAZON, Registration No. 2,832,943; APPLE, Registration No. 1,078,312; NIKE,
Registration No. 978,952. 36 See, e.g., JUST DO IT, Registration No. 1,875,307. 37 See, for example, Registration No. 4,129,188, in which the mark “consists of a moving image
mark, consisting of an animated sequence showing a series of rectangular video screens of varying
sizes, that fly inward in whirlwind fashion, as if from the viewer’s location, toward the center of
the viewer’s screen, where they coalesce into the word ‘HULU.’ The drawing represents three (3)
stills (freeze frames) from the animated sequence.” Id. 38 See, for example, Registration No. 1,145,473, in which the mark “is comprised of a ‘Wing’
design.” Id. 39 See, for example, Registration No. 3,457,218, for the shape of the original iPhone. 40 See, for example, Registration No. 1,045,615, for the exterior design of a McDonald’s restaurant.
41 See, for example, Registration No. 2,519,203, in which the mark consists of “the sound of a
deep, male, human-like voice saying ‘Ho-Ho-Ho’ in even intervals with each ‘Ho’ dropping in
pitch.” Id. 42 See, for example, Registration No. 3,143,735, for office supplies, in which “[t]he mark consists
of a vanilla scent or fragrance.” Id. 43 See, for example, Registration No. 3,155,702, in which “[t]he mark consists of a velvet textured
covering on the surface of a bottle of wine.” Id. 44 See, for example, Registration No. 2,793,439, for the scissor door configuration of a Lamborghini
automobile. “The mark consists of the unique motion in which the door of a vehicle is opened.
The doors move parallel to the body of the vehicle but are gradually raised above the vehicle to a
parallel position.” Id. So-called “nontraditional marks” of this nature are very rare. Of the
2,094,051 active registrations on the Principal Register in 2016, only 199 were for nontraditional
marks, of which most were sound marks. See infra Part II, pp. 973–77, for discussion of the Trademark
Case Files Dataset. 45 Marks that meet all requirements for registration are registered on the Principal Register. See
15 U.S.C. § 1052 (2012). Noninherently distinctive marks that are “capable of distinguishing applicant’s
goods or services” but that have not yet developed acquired distinctiveness are registrable on
the Supplemental Register provided that they meet all other requirements for registration. See id.
§ 1091. Registration on the Supplemental Register is of very limited value. See In re Federated
Dep’t Stores Inc., 3 U.S.P.Q.2d 1541, 1543 (T.T.A.B. 1987) (“It is overwhelmingly agreed that a

of text.46
Among the various requirements that a trademark must meet in order
to qualify for registration, a few merit further discussion below.
Where appropriate, our discussion focuses on the doctrine applying to
marks containing text because they constitute the great majority of
trademarks and are the focus of our study.
1. The Distinctiveness Requirement. — The most important requirement
by far that a mark must meet to qualify for registration is that it
be perceived by consumers as distinctive of its source.47 To determine
if a word mark qualifies as distinctive, trademark doctrine generally
classifies the mark into one of five categories: (1) “fanciful” marks, which
are coined words that bear no clear semantic relation to the goods or
services to which they are attached (such as EXXON for gasoline or
KODAK for photographic film); (2) “arbitrary” marks, which are preexisting
words that bear no clear semantic relation to their goods or services
(such as APPLE for computers or AMAZON for online retail services);
(3) “suggestive” marks, which are evocative but not directly
descriptive of their products’ characteristics (such as COPPERTONE
for suntan oil or IVORY for soap); (4) “descriptive” marks, which describe
their products’ characteristics (such as IPHONE for mobile
phones); and (5) “generic” marks, which refer to the type of product to
which they are affixed (such as ESCALATOR for moving staircase or
ASPIRIN for acetylsalicylic acid).48
Trademark law holds that fanciful, arbitrary, and suggestive marks
possess “inherent distinctiveness” of their source — and thus meet the
distinctiveness requirement on that basis — because consumers immediately
interpret them as designations of source rather than as descriptions
of the goods to which they are affixed.49 For example, as a matter
of basic consumer literacy, consumers would likely immediately perceive
a neologism like LENOVO embossed on the bezel of a computer monitor
as a designation of source. In contrast, consumers would likely interpret
a descriptive term like “high-definition” embossed on the bezel as a nonsource-specific
description of the product.

priority.” (citations omitted)). We study only registrations on the Principal Register to ensure that
our findings are based on marks that have been determined to be distinctive of source. 46 See infra Part II, pp. 973–77, for discussion of the Trademark Case Files Dataset. 47 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f). 48 See Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9–11 (2d Cir. 1976) (setting
out these categories); see also Sally Beauty Co. v. Beautyco, Inc., 304 F.3d 964, 975–76 (10th Cir.
2002). One of us is separately writing about how trademark law’s conventional distinctiveness
spectrum is misguided in multiple important ways, a topic well beyond the scope of this project.
See Jeanne C. Fromer, Overhauling Trademark Distinctiveness (Sept. 18, 2017) (unpublished manuscript)
(on file with author). 49 Sally Beauty Co., 304 F.3d at 976–77.
958 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
Unlike its treatment of fanciful, arbitrary, and suggestive marks,
trademark law holds that descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive
of source because consumers may interpret them as mere descriptions
of their products.50 To be registrable, descriptive marks must develop
“acquired distinctiveness” of source (also often called “secondary
meaning”).51 They typically do so over time through advertising and
use in the marketplace, which educate consumers that these marks are
designations of source rather than mere descriptions of their products’
characteristics.52
Finally, because they are understood to be incapable of source designation,
generic marks cannot be registered at the PTO.53
2. Classification of Goods and Services. — In addition to demonstrating
a trademark’s inherent or acquired distinctiveness, a trademark
applicant must specify the goods and services in connection with which
the applicant claims the exclusive right to use the mark.54 The applicant
must do so in the form of a written description of the goods and services
and also by reference to one or more of the forty-five categories of goods
and services contained in the International Classification of Goods and
Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks, otherwise known
as the “Nice Classification” after the French city where it was established
in 1957.
55 Now in its eleventh edition,56 the Nice Classification
is idiosyncratic.57 The different classes are not of comparable scope, as
the list of Nice Class Headings provided in Appendix A suggests. For
example, Class 26 narrowly covers “Lace and embroidery, ribbons and
braid; buttons, hooks and eyes, pins and needles; artificial flowers; hair
decorations; false hair.”58 Similarly, Class 34 covers “Tobacco; smokers’
articles; matches.”59 Meanwhile, Class 1 broadly covers “Chemicals

used in industry, science and photography, as well as in agriculture, horticulture
and forestry”60 and Class 12 covers “Vehicles; apparatus
for locomotion by land, air or water.”61 Figure 1 shows the relative
significance of the various Nice classes for all active trademark registrations
at the PTO in 2016. The data suggest that the most important
classes, as measured by active trademark registrations,62 are Class 9
(electronic goods), Class 16 (printed matter and publications), Class 25
(apparel goods), Class 35 (business administration services), Class 41
(education, entertainment, and cultural and sporting activities services),
and Class 42 (computer-related services). Though less heavily populated,
another economically important class is Class 5 (pharmaceuticals).
In our analysis of trademark depletion and congestion in Parts III and
IV, we often focus on certain of these classes and compare their classspecific
data to data drawn from all classes.63 We do so to illustrate the
implications of depletion and congestion for the most important economic
sectors.64
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
60 See infra app. at 1043. 61 See infra app. at 1044. 62 There is a strong correlation between the number of trademark registrations in a particular
Nice class and the economic importance of that class. As a 2016 U.S. government study shows,
trademark-intensive industries account for the largest number of intellectual-property-intensive industries
in the United States and contribute the most employment from such industries to the U.S.
economy. ECON. & STATISTICS ADMIN. & U.S. PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE, INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY AND THE U.S. ECONOMY: 2016 UPDATE, at ii, 8–9, 34–45 (Sept. 2016), https://
www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/IPandtheUSEconomySept2016.pdf [https://perma.cc/
3XVY-49UM]. 63 We used keywords to create our own classes of goods and services in certain areas of interest,
such as by combining beverages across Nice classes or by limiting a Nice class to a smaller subset
like software or automobiles. These bespoke classes yielded results sufficiently similar to Nice class
results that we report only the latter. 64 To avoid overwhelming and confusing readers, we do not consistently present class-specific
results for all classes or even for the economically most important classes. We present such results
only when we think it is instructive. When we do not, it is safe to assume that the class-specific
results generally follow the contours of the results for the overall population of applications or
diverge from those overall results in insignificant ways.

Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act bars the registration of a mark that so
resembles an already-registered mark “as to be likely, when used on or
in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to
cause mistake, or to deceive.”65 For example, on the basis of section
2(d), the PTO recently refused to register COW CREEK for beer in light

EMERALD AIRE for air conditioners,67 2GOOD for chocolate candy
in light of TOOGOOD for various goods including candy,68 and
LYTNING for protective industrial boots in light of LIGHTNING
GLOVES for disposable latex gloves.69 By contrast, the PTO has recently
found no likelihood of confusion under section 2(d) between the
mark BON O BON for chocolates and pastries and the mark BON
BON for sugar confectionary.70
Section 2(d) also bars the registration of any mark that is confusingly
similar to an unregistered “mark or trade name previously used in the
United States by another and not abandoned.”71 In practice, however,
due to the practical difficulties of identifying “previously used” unregistered
marks and determining whether they continue to be used in commerce,
the initial ex parte examination of the trademark application reviews
only registered marks for conflicts.72
The PTO refers to a number of factors to determine if an applicant’s
mark is confusingly similar to an already-registered mark.73 The most
important of these are (1) “[t]he similarity or dissimilarity of the marks
in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial
impression”; and (2) “[t]he relatedness of the goods or services as described
in the application and registration(s).”74 The PTO also considers
such factors as the similarity of the applicant’s and registrant’s channels
of trade, the sophistication of the relevant consumers, and “[t]he number
and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods”75 (on the assumption
that if the already-registered mark exists in a crowded field of similar
marks, it is entitled to only a narrow scope of protection).76

the PTO.77 Nonetheless, the law provides several important incentives
to encourage trademark owners to register their marks, including nationwide
priority in the mark from the date of application and enhanced
remedies.78
Yet if federal case law is any indication, trademark owners routinely
assert exclusive rights in unregistered marks.79 The Principal Register
thus significantly understates the number of commercial signifiers that
federal law actually protects as trademarks. For this reason, even a
study of the two million trademarks currently registered on the Principal
Register that contain text will allow only the most conservative estimate
of the full severity of any problem of word-mark depletion and congestion.
We think that this makes the empirical evidence of depletion
and congestion we present in Parts III and IV, which is based only on
marks registered on the Principal Register, all the more powerful.
B. The Finite Universe of “Good” Trademarks
With this background on trademark law set out, we now turn to the
legal and marketing considerations that limit the universe of potential
trademarks. Before doing so, we probe the conventional wisdom recited
by courts and commentators alike that there is an infinite stockpile of
possible trademarks.
1. The Conventional Wisdom Clarified. — As we stated above,
courts and commentators have long professed the belief that the supply
of potential trademarks is inexhaustible.80 They have done so since the
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
77 See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (2012) (providing anticonfusion protection to both registered and unregistered
marks). The Lanham Act’s protection of both registered and unregistered marks provokes
the important question whether marks that are refused registration might nonetheless be
protected as unregistered marks. In a thorough and thoughtful recent article on trademark registration,
Rebecca Tushnet addressed how the American scholarly approach of “treat[ing] registration
like a borrowed civil law coat thrown awkwardly over the shoulders of a common law regime”
leaves unanswered important questions like the status of a refused registration. Rebecca Tushnet,
Registering Disagreement: Registration in Modern American Trademark Law, 130 HARV. L. REV.
867, 871 (2017). Tushnet’s analysis leads her to understand “[r]egistration’s core problem [of trying]
to serve two goals that are only partially compatible: helping businesses order their affairs and
matching rights with consumer understanding.” Id. at 916. To fix this problem, registration needs
to become either more procedural or more substantive. Id. at 929–40. 78 See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1057(c), 1072 (nationwide constructive use conferring priority); id. § 1065
(possibility of the mark becoming incontestable after five years); id. § 1117(a)–(b) (enhanced
remedies).
79 See, e.g., Cross Commerce Media, Inc. v. Collective, Inc., 841 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 2016)
(asserting exclusive rights in unregistered mark COLLECTIVE); Uber Promotions, Inc. v. Uber
Techs., Inc., 162 F. Supp. 3d 1253, 1259 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (asserting exclusive rights in unregistered
mark UBER PROMOTIONS). 80 See, e.g., Florence Mfg. Co. v. J.C. Dowd & Co., 178 F. 73, 75 (2d Cir. 1910) (“It is so easy for
the honest business man, who wishes to sell his goods upon their merits, to select from the entire
material universe, which is before him, symbols, marks and coverings which by no possibility can
cause confusion between his goods and those of competitors . . . .”); supra note 1 and accompanying
text.

inception of modern trademark law in the nineteenth century81 and they
continue to do so.82 Typically no evidence or analysis is presented to
support this claim.
Stated in its most basic, unqualified form, the theoretical conjecture
that the supply of trademarks is inexhaustible is, like the claim that
there are infinitely many numbers, trivial. Firms can obviously coin
new words or phrases of ever-increasing length to avoid conflicts with
already-registered marks. But it is just as obvious that given the limits
of human cognition and communication, incumbent firms using shorter,
less complex, more familiar, more easily pronounced, and more evocative
marks will enjoy a significant competitive advantage over new
firms that must resort to brand names that are less effective along these
dimensions and for that reason remain unclaimed. In a seminal article
on the economic analysis of trademark law, William Landes and
Richard Posner explain the advantages of a short, memorable trademark:

Suppose you like decaffeinated coffee made by General Foods. If
General Foods’s brand had no name, then to order it in a restaurant or
grocery store you would have to ask for “the decaffeinated coffee made by
General Foods.” This takes longer to say, requires you to remember more,
and requires the waiter or clerk to read and remember more than if you can
just ask for “Sanka.”83
Landes and Posner were comparing a product branded SANKA to the
same product bearing no trademark at all. It is certainly possible to
imagine some Borgesian infinite universe of theoretically possible trademarks,
but much of that universe would consist of trademarks that are
comparable to, if not worse than, no trademark at all.84

964 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
The more interesting conjecture is that we will never exhaust the
supply of trademarks that are at least as competitively effective as those
already claimed. For shorthand, we refer to such marks as “good”
marks. This conjecture is not theoretical but empirical. It recognizes
that the universe of good trademarks is finite, but it asserts that, as a
practical matter, we will never exhaust it. Focusing on word marks, the
strong form of this conjecture is that there would still be a surplus of
good trademarks even if each firm in the economy wished to use a
unique word mark not confusingly similar to the word mark of any other
firm in the economy. A weaker form of the conjecture is that we will
never exhaust the supply of good trademarks even if each firm operating
in a particular class of goods or services wished to use a mark not confusingly
similar to the mark of any other firm operating in that class.
Both the strong and weak forms of the inexhaustibility conjecture
require some understanding of what constitutes a good, competitively
effective trademark. It is to this issue that we now turn.
2. The Characteristics of Good Trademarks. — There is an enormous
literature on how to choose a good brand name and on branding strategy
more generally. Not all of its advice is consistent. But the literature
does agree on a number of general principles concerning what makes
some trademarks more effective than others. We emphasize that these
are general principles. There are extremely successful brands that violate
one or all of them, and practices may vary by industry (for example,
pharmaceuticals). But on the whole, taking into account the entire population
of brand names, empirical studies show that firms that adhere
to these principles tend to perform better than those that do not.85
The first principle is that brand names that are unique are significantly
more effective than brand names that lack uniqueness.86 A brand
name may be unique in two respects. It may be unique in the sense that
only one firm in the economy uses the name. By contrast, brand names

holdings do not materially reflect the style implied by their new name,” id. at 2826); T. Clifton Green

that suffer from parallel uses, even when those uses do not confuse consumers
as to source, are less distinctive of their various owners. As the
trademark literature has recognized in a related context, consumers
must “think for a moment” upon exposure to the brand name to determine
to which company it refers.87 Parallel owners additionally face the
risk that another parallel user may tarnish the brand name, with the
damage spreading to all of its users.88 A brand name may also be unique
in the sense that it is significantly different from any other brand name
in the economy. This is the form of brand name uniqueness on which
marketers typically focus.89 GOOGLE is now a classic example of such
a unique mark. So-called “copycat” brand names that pattern themselves
after leading brands in their fields are generally thought to be
ineffective.90 All else equal, owners of unique trademarks, both unique
to their owners and unique as against all other marks, enjoy a considerable
competitive advantage.
Second, common English words when used in an arbitrary or suggestive
manner are generally more competitively effective than coined
words. In comparison to neologisms, common words such as APPLE
for computers or KIND for snack bars more readily impart a feeling of
familiarity and authenticity, and have proven themselves to be relatively
easy to pronounce, hear, read, and remember.91 These are all crucial
characteristics of effective trademarks — the nonsense naming of comic

seeks to economize on information costs by providing a compact, memorable and unambiguous
identifier of a product or service. The economy is less when, because the trademark has other
associations, a person seeing it must think for a moment before recognizing it as the mark of the

Cognitive Science, 86 TEX. L. REV. 507, 527–46 (2008) (expressing skepticism about this line of
thinking). 88 See Michael Handler, What Can Harm the Reputation of a Trademark? A Critical ReEvaluation
of Dilution by Tarnishment, 106 TRADEMARK REP. 639 (2016) (reviewing and undermining
the normative basis for dilution by tarnishment). 89 See, e.g., ALTMAN, supra note 86, at 73. 90 See WATKINS, supra note 86, at 24 (emphasizing that “[c]opycat names are lazy, lack originality,
and blatantly ride on a competitor’s coattails,” and can risk trademark infringement). That
is not to say that what makes a name unique and memorable is static. In fact, once other companies
have chosen names, to avoid being a copycat, one might need to look for a different type of name.
For example, Alexandra Watkins notes recent copycat trends to avoid, such as ______Monkey,
______Rocket, ______Daddy, _____.ly, i_____, e_____, double “o” (as in Google or Yahoo), fruit
names (like Apple and Blackberry), and Cloud. Id. at 25. 91 See id. at 35–38; Leslie Collins, A Name to Conjure with: A Discussion of the Naming of New
Brands, 11 EUR. J. MARKETING 339 (1977). But see ALTMAN, supra note 86, at 79–80 (“Not
understanding something right away is a great reason for someone to pay attention. Hell, they
might even look it up.”); Tushnet, supra note 87, at 533 (“High-frequency words are easy to process,
and thus we do not encode them distinctively, meaning that we do not pay much attention to them.
If they are used as brand names, we will have trouble remembering the brand. . . . Given that
advertisers have trouble getting consumers to pay attention to advertising in general, . . . lowfrequency
words seem more desirable as marks.” (footnote omitted)).

strip “xkcd” notwithstanding.92 It also generally requires less effort to
instill common words with brand meaning,93 especially when the words’
meanings and connotations sync with the brand’s message.94 Relatedly,
if a coined word is used, it tends to be more effective when it calls to
mind positively charged or brand-appropriate words more familiar to
the consumer. For example, VERIZON calls to mind “horizon,” suggesting
a forward-looking brand; INTEL suggests “intelligent;” and
VIAGRA calls to mind, all at once, “vigor,” “vitality,” “aggression,” and
“Niagara” (suggesting both water and honeymoons).95 Words that invoke
negatively charged words should be avoided. In a classic example,
the brand name for Ford’s ill-fated EDSEL automobile invoked “weasel”
and “pretzel” in association tests.96
Third, shorter trademarks are more effective than longer trademarks.
George Zipf observed a century ago that more common words
tend to be shorter than less common words.97 He hypothesized that this
maximized the efficiency of a language because shorter words require
less effort to use.98 The same reasoning applies to trademarks — and is
a further reason why brand names consisting of common English words
are preferred.99 Studies confirm that recognition and recall are better
for shorter words and shorter brand names.100 This explains why, as a

complex brand name becomes more successful, consumers will often try
to simplify it to make it easier to use — and the brand owner will then
typically register the abbreviation as its trademark. Consider, for example,
CHEVY for CHEVROLET, COKE for COCA-COLA, FEDEX for
FEDERAL EXPRESS, and KFC for KENTUCKY FRIED

be no longer than two syllables or seven letters.102

the proposition that sounds convey a range of properties, including
weight, speed, rigidity, activity, width, size, femininity, friendliness, and
sharpness.103 This ought not to be surprising. Compare, for example,

particular meanings transcends language and culture (and even
species).106 Studies show that the [ä] sound (as in “Frosh”) is shown to
connote smoother, richer, and creamier ice cream than the [i] sound (as
in “Frish”).107 The [u] sound in “dull” tends to suggest disgust or
dislike,108 which might be why the company behind SMUCKER’S jelly
developed the slogan, “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.”109
Because of its combination of sounds, “BLACKBERRY” connotes
speed, reliability, accessibility, smallness, and relaxation, while
“STRAWBERRY” connotes many of those same features (other than
relaxation), and slowness rather than speed.110 More generally, brands
that start with a plosive — a consonant that is a stop, namely, B, D, G,
K, P, T, or a hard C — are easier to remember and recognize.111
Fifth, ideally a brand name owner should be able to register its brand
name as a domain name in the .com top-level domain.112 However, as
new top-level domains become available and consumers increasingly
rely on search to navigate the internet, the advantages of such a registration
may be lessening.113
Opinions are mixed on other characteristics of more effective brand
names. Marketing experts (and trademark lawyers) generally advise
against descriptive terms.114 Yet one study shows that more descriptive

size, and more power.” Id. Research suggests that animal sounds also carry symbolic meaning,

brand names unsurprisingly result in higher consumer recall of the benefit
described by the brand name.115 Experts also advise against using
the business owner’s own name on the grounds, among others, that consumers
may not know the owner and that the brand may be more difficult
to sell to other owners at some point in the future.116 Yet personal
names, like common words, also convey authenticity and familiarity,
and company owners often have nonpecuniary reasons to prefer to use
their own names.117 Furthermore, while experts invariably emphasize
that good brand names are unique, it can also be beneficial for a new
brand name to share characteristics with other brand names in its product
space, because this helps to inform consumers about the nature
of the new brand and its product.118 One recent example is the use of
the “–ndr”/“–nder” suffix for dating apps: Tinder, Grindr, Blendr,
AdultFriendFinder, Lavendr (a gay dating app), Binder (a joke app to
break up with one’s significant other119), and the app formerly named
3nder (an app for those seeking threesomes).120
Finally, we note a line of reasoning that regularly appears in the
branding literature and that runs contrary to the principle that brand
names should consist of common English words. Experts reason that
new market entrants should consider coined words or less commonly
used English words but not because such words are more appealing to
consumers. Instead, the experts are essentially offering legal advice.

970 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
Their reasoning is that such words are less likely already to be claimed
by others and more likely to be registrable as trademarks.121
In sum, the branding literature strongly supports the proposition that
the supply of good, competitively effective trademarks is not just finite,
but far more limited than might generally be appreciated. The branding
literature further emphasizes what the economics literature often seems
to fail to appreciate122: that brand names are not fungible. Some are
better than others. A good brand name may not guarantee success, but
a bad brand name will often doom a product or company to oblivion,
as the example of EDSEL is often cited to show.123 Uniqueness is prized
above all. Common English words are more effective, as are shorter,
less complex words. Certain phonemes more readily convey desirable
meanings. Marks that can be registered as domain names in the .com
top-level domain have an advantage. Proprietors may want to use their
own name. All of these factors suggest means of measuring the degree
and rate of depletion and congestion of the supply of good trademarks.
We pursue these measures in Parts III and IV below.
C. Applicants’ Mark Selection
Together with marketing and branding principles, trademark law
and practice also influence applicants’ mark selection. Before applying
to register a particular mark, a firm typically engages in a process of
trademark clearance to determine if the mark it wishes to register is
already claimed either by a competitor or indeed by anyone else in the
economy. Since well before the time frame of the data studied here,
applicants have been able to use commercial trademark clearance services,
which maintain their own databases of previously and currently
used trademarks drawn from a variety of sources, such as trademark
applications and registrations at the federal and state level, state corporate
registration listings, and phone books.124 Since 2000, the PTO has
made freely available online the Trademark Electronic Search System

(TESS), an easy-to-use database allowing applicants to identify trademark
applications and registrations that might conflict with their prospective
trademark.125 Since about the same time, applicants have
typically also consulted internet search engines, such as Google, to determine
how their prospective marks are being used, if at all.126 Particularly
over the past decade, trademark clearance has become significantly
less expensive and time-consuming.127 The result is that
trademark applicants are increasingly likely to be aware of conflicting
“senior” applications and registrations. For this reason, we would expect
such applicants to be increasingly likely to avoid applying to register
trademarks that conflict, at least directly, with already-registered marks.
The fact that applicants will already have taken into account some
degree of trademark depletion and congestion in choosing marks has
important implications. Most significantly, because applicants are typically
applying with knowledge of which marks are already claimed, we
should not expect depletion or congestion to cause a dramatic decline in
the annual publication rate of trademark applications.128 And indeed,
as Figure 2 shows, though there has been an extraordinary increase in
the annual rate of trademark applications over recent decades (represented
by the bars and right axis in the figure), annual publication rates

search results).
127 See STEPHEN ELIAS & RICHARD STIM, TRADEMARK: LEGAL CARE FOR YOUR BUSINESS
& PRODUCT NAME 100–06 (10th ed. 2013). 128 If the PTO determines that the trademark application satisfies all requirements for registration,
including that it does not conflict under section 2(d) with an already-registered mark, the PTO
will approve the mark for publication in the Official Gazette. 15 U.S.C. § 1062(a) (2012). The
public then has thirty days from the date of publication to oppose the registration. Id. § 1063(a).
If no opposition is brought or succeeds, use-based applications (applications based on the applicant’s
current use of the mark) will automatically proceed to registration. Id. § 1063(b). Applications
based on an intent to use the mark require that a statement of actual use be filed before the
registration will issue. Id. § 1051(d). We focus on publication rates rather than registration rates
because many intent-to-use applications succeed to publication, but then fail to register because the
applicant fails to file a statement of use. See Barton Beebe, Is the Trademark Office a Rubber
Stamp?, 48 HOUS. L. REV. 751, 773, 774 tbl. 9 (2011).
 The PTO data indicate that oppositions are very rare. For applications filed from 1985
through 2014, only 2.10% were opposed and only 0.90% were opposed successfully. Interestingly,
however, opposition rates have been steadily declining over this period, from a high of 3.42% of
applications filed in 1987 receiving an opposition to a low of 1.63% of applications filed in 2014
receiving an opposition. Annual rates of successful oppositions have also been slightly declining
over this period. See infra Part II, pp. 973–77, for discussion of the Trademark Case Files
Dataset. We tentatively suggest that these trends, which deserve further study, may reflect the
effects of increasing section 2(d) refusal rates discussed below in Part III.D, pp. 1003–08.

have remained steady (represented by the line and left axis in the figure).129
Even during the internet boom, which largely accounts for the
spike in applications in 1999 and 2000, publication rates declined only
from 0.75 in 1998 to 0.68 in 2000, and then quickly recovered.
Figure 2: Applications and Publication Rate
by Filing Year, 1985–2016
Instead of a declining publication rate, we should expect to see especially
stark evidence of trademark depletion and congestion in changes
in the characteristics of the marks for which applicants are applying.
To be sure, many factors other than depletion and congestion may affect
which marks applicants will choose to prosecute, chief among them
trends in marketing. But further complicating matters, there is good
evidence to suggest that these trends may themselves emerge out of an
awareness of depletion and congestion.130 Finally, some less sophisticated
applicants may be entirely unaware of the resources available to
them that may aid them in finding or understanding the legal implications
of preexisting, conflicting marks, while other highly sophisticated
applicants may use those resources, discover conflicting marks, and
plow ahead fully aware of the risk of a section 2(d) refusal. We address
these issues further in Parts III and IV.

129 We do not report the publication-rate data past 2014 because some applications filed after
2014 may not have been fully processed by the end of 2016, when the data on which this figure is
based were compiled. For this reason, subsequent figures that report publication, registration, or
section 2(d) refusal rates stop at 2014. 130 See, e.g., Begley, supra note 95 (“[A]s winning hybrids of real words become scarcer than a

II. THE DATASETS
We use six datasets. The main dataset for this study is the PTO’s
Trademark Case Files Dataset, which the PTO made publicly available
in 2012 and has since updated annually.131 The dataset provides detailed
information about all 6.9 million trademark applications filed at
the PTO from 1982 through 2016, including data on applicant and mark
characteristics, prosecution events, and ownership and renewal history.132
The dataset also provides more limited information on the
208,105 trademarks already registered at the PTO as of 1982 that were
based on applications filed before 1982. Derived directly from the
PTO’s own internal database and curated by the Office of the Chief
Economist of the PTO, the dataset is of very high quality.
A significant limitation of the Trademark Case Files Dataset, however,
is that it does not indicate on what grounds the PTO refused applications
when it did so. We therefore developed a second, original
dataset of all office actions issued by the PTO from 2003, when the PTO
began posting its office actions online, through 2016. This entailed systematically
downloading some 2.1 million office actions from the PTO

of the Trademark Case Files Dataset, Google made available in bulk download format much of the
data on which the Trademark Case Files Dataset is based. See USPTO Bulk Downloads: Trademark

[https://perma.cc/6VQJ-5BVH] [hereinafter USPTO BULK DOWNLOADS].
These raw data files formed the basis of initial quantitative studies of certain aspects of the trademark
registration process. See, e.g., Beebe, supra note 128, at 759–60 (using data from USPTO
BULK DOWNLOADS, supra, to examine trademark publication and registration rates at the PTO);
Deborah R. Gerhardt & Jon P. McClanahan, Do Trademark Lawyers Matter?, 16 STAN. TECH. L.
REV. 583, 584 (2013) (using the data from USPTO BULK DOWNLOADS, supra, to “assess[] whether
trademark applicants benefit from having an attorney assist in the registration process”). A more
recent quantitative study of trademark registration has used the Trademark Case Files Dataset.
See Jeremy N. Sheff, Dilution at the Patent and Trademark Office, 21 MICH. TELECOMM. &
TECH. L. REV. 79, 81–82 (2014) (using the Trademark Case Files Dataset to examine rates of “registration
of identical marks to different parties in different product classes” and to evaluate the
effect of antidilution law on these rates).
132 The dataset also provides partial information about a significant proportion of trademark
applications filed from 1870 through 1981. See GRAHAM ET AL., supra note 131, at 3; see also
Beebe, supra note 128, at 760 (discussing differences in the data from USPTO BULK DOWNLOADS,
supra note 131, between observations with filing dates before the early 1980s and those with filing
dates after). In much of the statistical analysis that follows, we limit our findings to a population
consisting of applications from 1985 through 2016 and trademarks already registered at the PTO
as of 1985. We exclude the years 1982 through 1984 because of a variety of anomalies in the data
for that period (for example, rapid shifts in annual publication rates) that may be of historical interest
but are not central to the study of trademark depletion and congestion.

In order to study applications and registrations for common English
words, we use the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)
rank order of the 100,000 most frequently used words in American
English.133 COCA is the largest structured corpus of American
English.134 The version of COCA we use consists of more than 450
million words of text drawn from television and radio broadcasts, fiction,
popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals over the
years 1990 through 2012, with approximately twenty million words from
each year. (From this corpus, we learn such important information as
that Americans use the word “no” (our 72nd most frequently used word)

English, 25 LITERARY & LINGUISTIC COMPUTING 447 (2010). The data is available on a proprietary
basis from Professor Mark Davies. We downloaded the data on November 4, 2014.
COCA’s rank order does not include the trademarks “Microsoft,” “iPad,” or “Gucci,” but it does
include “surface,” “apple,” and “bamboo,” when they are used as common nouns, as the 1122nd,
2666th, and 10,968th most frequently used words, respectively. Nor does the rank order include
the proper noun “America,” but it does include the adjective “American” (161st). More generally,
the corpus excludes proper nouns but might include, depending on usage frequency, proper adjectives
and a very limited number of words that originated as trademarks but grew into common
usage, such as “google,” which ranks as the 17,894th most frequently used word (and which was
derived from the word “googol,” denoting ten raised to the power of a hundred). 134 Davies, supra note 133. This corpus is regularly used for research in linguistics, computational
linguistics, psychology, and marketing. See, e.g., Eric K. Acton & Christopher Potts, That Straight

more frequently than “yes” (211th), “hell” (1420th) more frequently than
“heaven” (3409th), and “war” (216th) more frequently than “peace”
(899th).) COCA ranks the frequency with which a word appears in the
form of a particular part of speech. Thus, a word like “can” may appear
multiple times in the ranking (“can” as a verb and “can” as a noun). For
purposes of this study, we collapsed these multiple rankings into one
ranking based on the raw frequency of the word regardless of part of
speech. This resulted in a rank order of 86,408 words (collapsed from
100,000), which is the rank order we used for our statistical analysis and
to which we will refer in what follows. We use the terms “standard
English words” or “common English words” to refer to all words that
appear in this rank order.
COCA’s frequency ranking also provides an estimate of the proportion
of overall word usage consisting of a particular word in a particular
part of speech. As we did with COCA’s frequency ranking, we collapsed
these estimates to establish the raw proportion of overall word usage
consisting of the word regardless of part of speech. Doing so allows us
in Part III to estimate not just the precise number of the 86,408 most
frequently used words that are already claimed as trademarks, but also
the proportion of word usage that these already-claimed words represent.
This is important because word frequency roughly follows a power
law distribution known as Zipf’s law.135 COCA’s data indicate that the
ten most frequently used words account for 21.4% of word usage; the
100 most frequently used words, 44.9%; and the 1000 most frequently
used words, 65.4%. Meanwhile, the 10,000th to the 86,408th most frequently
used words account for only 4.9% of word usage. (Overall,
COCA’s full list of words accounts for 89.1% of word usage.) Depletion
and congestion of very high-frequency words arguably have a far more
significant impact on competitors, consumers, and the public domain
than do depletion and congestion of lower-frequency words.
To assess surname depletion and congestion, we use the U.S. Census
Frequently Occurring Surnames from the Census 2000 dataset, which
ranks the frequency of all 151,671 surnames appearing 100 or more
times in the Census 2000 returns.136 The Census data also provide an

16, http://www2.census.gov/topics/genealogy/2000surnames/surnames.pdf [https://perma.cc/7V34-
5WBV]. We use the Census 2000 data rather than the more recent Census 2010 data because the
former describes the U.S. population closer to the midpoint of the timespan covered by our trademark
data, which runs from the mid-1980s to the present.
976 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
estimate for each surname of the proportion of the U.S. population using
that surname.137 These data enable us to estimate both the proportion
of surnames already claimed as trademarks as well as the proportion of
the population that uses those surnames. (Overall, the Census data
cover 89.8% of the population,138 with the 1000 most commonly occurring
surnames covering 40.6% of the population.) We use the term
“common American surnames” to refer to all surnames in the Census
rank order.
Because trademark applicants now typically also seek to determine
if the trademarks they wish to register are already registered as domain
names,139 we use Verisign’s .COM TLD Zone File, which lists all .com
domain names, to study the proportion of common English words, common
American surnames, and short neologisms that are already registered
as domain names in the .com top-level domain.140
Finally, to study the depletion of potential neologisms, we use an
original dataset comprising phonetic representations of all words included
in all trademark applications and registrations in the Trademark
Case Files Dataset. To develop this dataset, we used the Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU) Pronouncing Dictionary, which provides the
pronunciation broken down by phonemes for some 134,000 American
English words.141 For words appearing in a trademark application but
not in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, we used the Carnegie Mellon
University LOGIOS Lexicon Tool to infer a phonetic representation of
the word.142 We combined these data with COCA to develop a list of
the 10,753 unique syllables found in COCA, encoded phonetically, along
with their frequency data.143 We use this list to assess the depletion and

III. WORD-MARK DEPLETION
The concept of trademark depletion is not new to trademark law.
We adapt it from the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Qualitex Co. v.
Jacobson Products Co.,
145 which held that the Lanham Act permits the
registration of a mark consisting of a single color if the mark otherwise
meets the requirements for trademark protection.146 In so holding, the
Qualitex Court rejected Jacobson’s argument that allowing the registration
of single colors “will ‘deplete’ the supply of usable colors to the
point where a competitor’s inability to find a suitable color will put that
competitor at a significant disadvantage.”147 The Court reasoned that:
When a color serves as a mark, normally alternative colors will likely be
available for similar use by others. Moreover, if that is not so — if a “color
depletion” or “color scarcity” problem does arise — the trademark doctrine
of “functionality” normally would seem available to prevent the anticompetitive
consequences that Jacobson’s argument posits, thereby minimizing
that argument’s practical force.148
Yet the functionality doctrine149 would not prevent the kind of colormark
depletion that Jacobson was describing in Qualitex, which was the
depletion by many different competitors of nonfunctional colors, such
as the green-gold color for dry-cleaning press pads at issue in the case.150
Instead, at the core of the Court’s rejection of the color depletion argument
was simply the assumption that Qualitex and its competitors
would never exhaust the supply of colors that may be used as singlecolor
trademarks.
We think the case that word-mark depletion has begun to have anticompetitive
consequences is substantially stronger than the comparable
case was for color-mark depletion in Qualitex. We make that case
in this Part. We begin in section A by outlining a framework for evaluating
word-mark depletion. Section B then shows that a strikingly high

the functionality doctrine would bar their registration in any case.
978 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
and one-syllable words — among the most desirable categories of
marks — are already claimed by at least one trademark registrant either
as a single-word mark or as part of a multi-word mark. We further
show that an even higher proportion of frequently used words are
claimed in the .com top-level domain space. In sections C and D, we
turn to historical trends in applicant behavior, specifically, in the kinds
of word marks for which applicants are applying and which they are
ultimately registering. These trends are consistent with applicants’ own
recognition of and attempt to adapt to the problem of word-mark depletion.
Section E focuses on the increasing proportion of applications
that fail to pass the examination stage of the registration process because
they conflict with already-registered marks. Even while applicants are
generally attempting to adapt to word-mark depletion, many are still
applying for and failing to register marks that others have already
claimed. Finally, section F shows that incumbent applicants (those applying
based on preexisting registrations) have to some extent been able
to avoid the problem of word-mark depletion by taking advantage of
associated preexisting registrations. The benefits of incumbency reveal
the severity of the problem of word-mark depletion for market entrants,
an issue we analyze in greater depth in Part V.
A. A Framework for Evaluating Word-Mark Depletion
Word-mark depletion is the process by which a decreasing number
of potential word marks remain unclaimed by any trademark owner.
Note that because an entity may in some instances register a mark that
has already been claimed by another, depletion does not necessarily entail
a decline in the number of potential marks that remain available for
registration. That said, the two concepts are closely connected: increased
rates of depletion can readily lead to increased unavailability of
marks. Understood in its broadest sense, word-mark depletion describes
the depletion of the set of all possible word marks with respect to the
set of all classes of goods and services. But word-mark depletion may
take more specific forms. A particular set of word marks (for example,
common English words)151 may be depleted with respect to a particular
class of goods and services (for example, apparel). Depletion may take
even more specific forms. Individual words may be depleted in individual
classes. The concept of depletion is highly flexible, but the process
of depletion is best evaluated in two dimensions: in terms of the depletion
of a set of marks with respect to a set of goods or services.
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
151 We could generalize our analysis of depletion and congestion to categories, or sets, of words
that are infinite, such as the set of all possible words made from the English alphabet or the set of
all phonetically and orthographically possible English words. Generalizing to infinite word categories
would complicate the explication of the framework but not the analytical framework itself.
To simplify the explication, we therefore continue with an analysis only of finite word categories.
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 979
In what follows, we focus on the aspects of word-mark depletion that
are most relevant to assessing the degree of depletion of “good,” competitively
effective marks. As for the sets of marks on which we focus, the
marketing literature identifies three sets of particular interest: common
English words; all possible short, pronounceable neologisms; and surnames.
As for the sets of goods and services, because marks unique to
only one firm in the economy are especially effective, we assess depletion
with respect to the set of all classes of goods and services. But because
firms will often settle for being the only user of a particular mark merely
within their class, we also assess depletion by class.
Adding to the complications that attend the concept of word-mark
depletion are two further considerations. The first is that a particular
word-mark registration in a particular class does not simply deplete the
word it identically matches with respect to that class. It also constructively
depletes all similar words in that class whose use would confuse
consumers as to source. For instance, a registration for BLUE in Class
25, for apparel, would likely disallow another entity from registering in
that class BLU, BLEU, BLUE MAN, and quite possibly even similarsounding
marks such as BLOW as well. Furthermore, even if consumers
might not be confused by such marks or in any case even if the PTO
might allow their registration, applicants may consider them unavailable
because the prior registration and use of BLUE impairs the uniqueness
of all marks similar to it. BLUE makes BLU, BLEU, BLUE
MAN, and BLOW less distinctive in that they are less different from
other marks. Thus, a proper evaluation of depletion must incorporate
some method for assessing not just identity, but also nonidentical similarity
between already-claimed marks and the overall supply of possible
marks. As we explain further below, to do so we use Jaro-Winkler distance,
which is a quantitative measure of the similarity between two
strings.
A second complication of word-mark depletion is that the depletion
of some words may have a more significant effect on competition than
the depletion of others. The costs of depletion, in other words, are not

Courts and commentators have long recognized that the depletion of
generic and descriptive terms in particular can be especially damaging
to competition, as they are especially important for all competitors in a
particular space to use in the course of doing business.152 For this

(“Consumers will not benefit . . . if trademark law prevents competitors from using generic or descriptive
terms to inform the public of the nature of their product. Were the first user of a generic
or descriptive term, say ‘bicycle,’ able to exclude later entrants from use of that term, the former

good will it has built up — legitimate purposes of trademark protection — but also to impair the

reason, generic terms are barred from registration.153 Descriptive terms
are registrable, but depletion concerns arguably underlie both
trademark law’s requirement that these terms acquire distinctiveness in
order to receive protection and the law’s descriptive fair use defense.
While the acquired-distinctiveness requirement is largely based on the
law’s underlying limitation that it will grant exclusive rights only in
signs that consumers perceive as designations of source,154 it also reflects
the law’s cognizance of the cost of granting exclusive rights in key terms
that businesses need to use extensively to operate.155 Similarly, the
descriptive fair use defense permits a business to use a competitor’s
protected descriptive mark so long as this use is “in good faith only to
describe [the business’s] goods or services.”156 This defense recognizes
that fair competition requires access to descriptive terms and thus limits
the scope of trademark protection for descriptive marks.157
The example of generic and descriptive marks counsels that any
analysis of depletion should attempt to incorporate some measure of a
word mark’s importance to competition and to the public domain.
Though our measure is rough, for common English words we use the
frequency rank of the word and the proportion of overall word usage
for which the word is responsible as an indicator of the cost the depletion
of the word imposes on the trademark system. Similarly, with respect
to surnames, we use the frequency rank of the surname and the proportion
of the population that uses the surname. For neologisms, we use

B. Evidence of Word-Mark Depletion in Words Already Registered
For purposes of exposition, we begin in section 1 by presenting data
on identical matches between active trademark registrations, on the one
hand, and common English words, common American surnames, and
possible one-syllable words, on the other. Even these data present compelling
evidence of word-mark depletion. But they only hint at the extent
of the problem. We present in sections 2 and 3 more disturbing
evidence of depletion in the form of data showing the proportion of
words and surnames that, even if not identical to already-registered
marks, are confusingly similar to such marks, either because the word
or surname is only slightly different from the registered mark or because
the word or surname appears within the mark. Section 4 then focuses
on domain names in the .com top-level domain.
1. Identical Matches. — In evaluating the proportion of words and
surnames that identically match an already-registered mark, we necessarily
study the registration of such words and surnames in the form of
single-word marks. Single-word registrations are significant because
they potentially yield considerable competitive advantages to their owners.
They do so for two reasons. First, all else equal, single-word registrations
typically form the basis of broader rights than multi-word registrations,
whose exclusivity is limited only to uses that are confusingly
similar with respect to all of the words registered.158 For example, the
registration of the single word FUTURE claims a broader scope of exclusivity
than the registration of the words FUTURE QUEST. At least
in principle, the former is potentially infringed by any use of or use similar
to FUTURE, either alone or with any other words, including
QUEST. In contrast, FUTURE QUEST is potentially infringed only
by uses of or uses similar to both FUTURE and QUEST in combination.
Second, single-word registrations are also competitively advantageous
because of their low word count. All else equal, single words are
typically easier to remember than multiple words strung together.159
Easier recall by consumers makes single-word marks attractive to
businesses.
(a) Frequently Used Words. — A strikingly high number of the most
frequently used words in American English are already registered as
single-word trademarks. As Table 1 indicates, in 2016, 813 (81.3%) of

is that the less that is registered, the greater the scope of protection afforded.”).
159 See generally supra pp. 966–67 (discussing the fact that shorter words are more desirable for
branding because consumers can recall them better).
982 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
the 1000 most frequently used words identically matched an active
single-word mark, and 6188 (61.9%) of the 10,000 most frequently used
words did so. Overall, 20,295 (23.5%) of the 86,408 most frequently used
words in American English were claimed as single-word marks.160
These 20,295 words account for 74.0% of all word usage. In effect,
when we use our language, nearly three-quarters of the time we are
using a word that someone has claimed as a trademark.

What words remain unclaimed? Studying the registration status of
the 1000 most frequently used words may offer some insight. In 2016,
187 of these words remained unclaimed. Most of these words would not
likely succeed as trademarks, either because they carry negative connotations
(such as “despite,” “died,” “difficult,” “disease,” “killed,” “lack,”
“loss,” “older,” “problem,” and violence”), questionable sales appeal (such
as “least,” “perhaps,” “probably,” and “trying”), or strong basic meanings
that would likely impede successful branding (such as “drug,” “religious,”
and “wants”). Also notable is the large number of words relating
to gender and family that are frequently used but not claimed as trademarks
(such as “husband,” “wife,” “married,” “male,” “woman,” “daughter,”
“herself,” and “himself”).
These data indicate that it is becoming more difficult for entrants to
claim frequently used English words that no other firm is using anywhere
in the economy. But firms will often settle for a parallel use
provided that other firms that are using the mark are doing so in a different
economic sector and in a nonconfusing manner. For this reason,
we also look more specifically at the proportion of the most frequently
used words that are claimed as single-word marks within particular
classes of goods and services.161
Figure 4 shows, for each Nice class of goods and services, the
proportion of word usage consisting of words claimed as single-word
trademarks in that class. Certain classes show significant degrees of
word-mark depletion — specifically, Class 9 (electronic goods), Class 25
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
161 In presenting class-by-class results in this Article, we make several simplifying assumptions.
First, we assume that a registration in one Nice class will not deplete, congest, or cause confusion
with any potential mark in another class. This assumption makes our results conservative because
goods and services in different classes may be sufficiently related such that the registration of a
mark in one class may preclude another’s registration of the same mark in another class. For
example, a mark registered in Class 25 (apparel goods) may preclude another’s registration of the
same mark in Class 14 (precious metals, including jewelry). On the other hand, we make a second
simplifying assumption, that a registration in one Nice class can deplete, congest, or cause confusion
with other potential marks in that same class, even though that is not always the case, particularly
for classes that combine many disparate goods or services, such as Class 35 (general business services).
Cf. Tushnet, supra note 77, at 880–81 (discussing the same two possibilities, and how registrations
therefore do not provide sufficient notification of the extent of infringement liability). Finally,
we make another simplifying assumption by treating all marks containing text similarly.
However, text marks can consist of standard character marks that make no claim “to any particular
font style, size, or color,” 37 C.F.R. § 2.52(a) (2016), stylized character marks in which the registration
claims rights in the text only in its particular stylized font, or image marks containing text. See
Drawing of Your Mark, U.S. PAT. & TRADEMARK OFF., https://www.uspto.gov/
trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics/representation-mark [https://perma.cc/5YHR-MN2B].
For the years 1985 through 2016, 72.4% of applications consisted of only standard character marks,
5.3% consisted of only stylized character marks, and 19.1% consisted of image marks containing
text. Standard character marks potentially have the broadest scope because they are not limited to
a particular stylization, whereas the other two categories tend to be narrower because of the stylization
or design elements that appear with them. Cf. supra p. 981 (applying a similar principle to
one- versus multi-word marks).

disclaimed COMPUTER and INC.162 We designed the protocol in this
manner because trademark examiners are instructed to include disclaimed
language in their section 2(d) assessment of mark similarity.163
However, excluding disclaimed language from the mark enables our
matching protocol to focus on what is most often the dominant portion
of the mark, which is undoubtedly APPLE in our example. This focus
is appropriate. In their section 2(d) assessment of similarity, examiners
are also instructed to consider the dominant portion of the mark.164
When we test for identical matches between frequently used words
and registered marks with their disclaimed language removed, the proportion
of words already claimed increases. In 2016, of the 86,408 words
listed in our word frequency table, 24,702 (28.6%) identically matched a
registered mark with disclaimed language removed. These 24,702
words account for 78.9% of all word usage in American English. This
percentage has been increasing over time, but not as dramatically as
shown above in Figure 3 with respect to identical matches to full marks.
This is because already in 1985 65.9% of all word usage consisted of a
word identically matching a registered mark with disclaimed language
removed. That percentage steadily increased each year to the 78.9%
figure for 2016.
For the 1000 most frequently used words in particular, 899 identically
matched registrations with disclaimed language removed. As for
particular Nice classes, Figure 4 shows that the proportions of alreadyclaimed
words are often nearly double those reported for marks with
disclaimed language included. The dramatic difference between the results
of identical matching of words to full marks and identical matching
of word to marks with disclaimed language removed hints at how severe

An applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark sought to be registered.”
15 U.S.C. § 1056(a) (2012). Applicants disclaiming portions of word marks do so typically because
they are generic or descriptive (without the requisite secondary meaning). See, e.g., Brandon Meyer,
What Happens if I Can’t Get Away with It?: Disclaimer Law and Practice, 19 J. CONTEMP. LEGAL
ISSUES 125, 125–29 (2010). Nonetheless, a disclaimer does not prejudice an applicant’s common
law rights or any future rights that might arise as to disclaimed words. 15 U.S.C. § 1056(b). Furthermore,
disclaimed language still might be protectable, because courts evaluate it together with
nondisclaimed language in assessing trademark infringement. E.g., Juice Generation, Inc. v. GS

1243 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
 In our data, of the 5,107,791 applications filed from 1985 through 2016 that succeeded to
publication, 1,376,168 (26.9%) contained disclaimed language. This is a sizeable number. We have
collected significant data about trademark disclaimers and plan to study them, their legal effect,
and the desirability of potential protection for disclaimed language in future work. 163 In re MCI Commc’ns Corp., 21 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1534, 1538 (T.T.A.B. 1991); TMEP, supra

the problem of word-mark depletion actually is — especially when we
take into account, as we do in a moment, nonidentical similarity.165
(b) Frequently Occurring Surnames. — As mentioned above, the
U.S. Census data allow us to estimate the proportion of the U.S. population
that carries a surname already claimed as a registered mark.166
We thus measure surname depletion according to this metric. The
Census dataset lists 151,671 surnames. Of these, 22,125 identically
match a mark registered in 2016. Census data indicate that these 22,125
surnames represent 55.4% of the U.S. population. Thus, over half of all
Americans carry a surname that has already been claimed as a singleword
trademark. Figure 5 shows the steady increase over time in
the proportion of the population carrying a surname claimed as a
trademark.

165 We note that there is also significant depletion of individual letters and short letter combinations.
In 2016, all twenty-six letters identically matched an active registration in some class of goods
or services. In each of the most economically significant classes (5, 9, 25, 35, and 41), each letter
was claimed as a single-letter mark by at least one registrant and often by multiple registrants. Of
the 676 possible two-letter combinations, all but four (IY, UJ, XU, and YQ) identically matched an
active registration in 2016 in some class of goods or services — and UJ has since been registered,
UJ, Registration No. 5,243,465, while YQ, U.S. Trademark Application Serial No. 79,196,783 (filed
July 19, 2016), and XU, U.S. Trademark Application Serial No. 86,900,821 (filed Feb. 8, 2016), are
the subject of applications currently under review. As for specific classes: In Class 9, 85.5% of all
two-letter combinations were claimed; in Class 25, 80.6%; in Class 35, 78.7%; and in Class 41,
73.8%. Overall, 58.9% of the 17,576 possible three-letter combinations identically matched an active
registration in 2016 in some class of goods or services, and 5.1% of the 456,976 possible fourletter
combinations were claimed in some class of goods or services.

With respect to the registration of surnames as single-word marks in
specific classes of goods and services, certain classes show significant
depletion. For Class 9 (electronic goods), 30.3% of the population carries
a surname triggering an identical match. For Class 25 (apparel goods),
22.4% of the population does so. With respect to Class 35 (general business
administration services), a little over one in four Americans (26.6%
of the population) carry surnames already registered as single-word
marks. Interestingly, in Classes 6 (metal goods) and 7 (machine goods),
surname depletion is also significant, at 20.5% and 23.6% of the population,
respectively. In essence, substantial portions of the American
population have simply been born too late to claim their surnames as
single-word marks in certain classes of goods and services.
When we compare the most frequently occurring surnames to marks
with disclaimed language removed, we find a higher proportion of the
population carrying surnames already claimed as single-word marks. In
2016, 61.5% of the population carried a surname identically matching a
registered mark with disclaimed language removed. The proportions
are similarly higher with respect to specific classes of goods and services.
For example, for Class 9 (electronic goods), 35.4% of the population carried
a surname triggering an identical match, while 39.1% did so for
Class 35 (business administration services), and 27.7% for Class 25 (apparel
goods).
(c) One-Syllable Words. — It is often assumed that the supply of
trademarks is inexhaustible because new firms can simply coin new
words.167 Yet the supply of new words that may serve as competitively
effective trademarks is limited. Firms that choose neologisms generally
prefer short, easily pronounceable, familiar-sounding, and reasonably
euphonious terms.168 Our data indicate that this limited supply of new
words is itself being depleted.
To study this form of depletion, we focus on all potential one-syllable
words in English.169 To estimate a list of such terms, we use a frequency
table of the 10,753 distinct syllables appearing in the words of the
Corpus of Contemporary American English. We then compare these
syllables to all applied-for and registered marks. Here, our matching
protocol is based not on identical string matching but on identical phonetic
matching. We are interested primarily in matching syllables that
sound the same. In sum, we study identical matches between the phonetic
representations of syllables appearing in the corpus and the phonetic
representations of syllables appearing in the trademark application
and registration data. For example, the words “Phil” and “fill” would

constraints, we focus on one-syllable English words to give a sense of the proportion of
the supply of plausible neologisms that conflict with already-registered marks.
988 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
match phonetically even though they are spelled differently, while the
“ant” in “ant” and “variant” would not match phonetically even though
they have the same spelling.
Overall, of the 10,753 most frequently used syllables in American
English, 5632 (52.4%) are claimed as one-syllable marks. These 5632
syllables account for 80.8% of all syllable usage in the language. Figure
6 shows the extraordinary increase over time in the proportion of syllable
usage consisting of a syllable claimed as a single-word mark, from a
low of 64.8% in 1985 to our present condition in which over four-fifths
of the syllables we use are registered as one-syllable marks.

Which syllables remain unclaimed? Just as we did for frequently
used words, we look at which syllables remain unclaimed among a subset
of the most frequently used syllables for some insight. Of the one
hundred most frequently used syllables, twenty were free of conflicts
with a registered mark in 2016. Table 2 lists them. It is not surprising
that these syllables remain free. Better suited to multisyllabic words,
none would serve as an effective single-syllable trademark.

The kinds of syllables listed in Table 2 are representative of the larger
population of the 5130 syllables appearing in the corpus that remain
unregistered as one-syllable marks. A broader look at this population
typically shows such unlikely one-syllable brand names as “wuh,” “duh,”
“gehn,” “gehnst,” “erf,” and “gloud.”
Comparing single-syllable marks with all syllables appearing in the
corpus also shows which syllables have been coined by trademark registrants.
Here we find a large number of almost comically obtuse brand
names: GLOG,170 GUK,171 LUNK,172 SKIDE,173 TSUGE,174
ZOOTH,175 KNIRPS.176 To be sure, some firms may seek to distinguish
themselves by the relative awkwardness of their brand names, but this
cannot be an effective strategy for all new trademark registrants. When
taking into account the marketing goals of typical firms, we see significant
depletion of neologisms that promise to be at least minimally competitively
effective.

why, as we show below, applicants are increasingly shifting away from
applying for common words and surnames.
To assess nonidentical similarity, we employ the Jaro-Winkler measure
of the edit distance between two strings. Edit distance is a measure
of the number of operations, such as insertions, deletions, or transpositions,
required to transform one string into another. For example, “chat”
needs one deletion and nothing further to transform it to “cat.” We use
the Jaro-Winkler distance measure because it incorporates character
transpositions into its measure of distance and places more weight, as
people do, on the initial characters of the strings being compared.177
Jaro-Winkler distance is normalized such that a distance of 1 indicates
an exact match and a distance of 0 indicates no similarity.178 We use a
conservative threshold of 0.875 to indicate a confusingly similar
match.179 To further tighten our similarity-matching protocol, we use
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
177 For these reasons, the Jaro-Winkler measure is superior to other measures of edit distance,
such as Levenshtein distance and Jaro distance. The Jaro-Winkler measure is set out in William
E. Winkler, String Comparator Metrics and Enhanced Decision Rules in the Fellegi-Sunter Model
of Record Linkage, in SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS SECTION, JSM PROCEEDINGS 354 (1990),
http://ww2.amstat.org/sections/srms/Proceedings/ [https://perma.cc/YY6Z-JRS5]. Computer scientists
have developed much more sophisticated methods of measuring the phonetic and semantic
similarity of words. See, e.g., Fatahiyah Mohd Anuar, Rossitza Setchi & Yu-Kun Lai, Semantic
Retrieval of Trademarks Based on Conceptual Similarity, 46 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS,
MAN & CYBERNETICS 220 (2016); Fatahiyah Mohd Anuar, Rossitza Setchi & Yu-Kun Lai, Trademark
Retrieval Based on Phonetic Similarity, in PROCEEDINGS: 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN & CYBERNETICS 1642 (2014) [hereinafter Anuar, Setchi &
Lai, Trademark Retrieval]; Grzegorz Kondrak, Phonetic Alignment and Similarity, 37 COMPUTERS
& HUMAN. 273, 284–86 (2003) (setting out the ALINE algorithm for assessing phonetic similarity).
Fatahiyah Mohd Anuar, Rossitza Setchi, and Yu-Kun Lai in particular have proposed an
algorithm that, by their estimate, significantly improves upon the Levenshtein approach and
Grzegorz Kondrak’s ALINE algorithm. Anuar, Setchi & Lai, Trademark Retrieval, supra, at 1646–
47. In subsequent work, we hope to employ these improved algorithms. But because we use a very
conservative threshold for similarity, we expect that these improved algorithms will produce even
stronger evidence of word-mark depletion among frequently used words.
178 See Winkler, supra note 177, at 356. 179 We characterize a 0.875 Jaro-Winkler threshold as conservative for our purposes because it
yields very few false positives. But it does so at the cost of a significant number of false negatives.
As compared with the word “apple,” for example, the following words would yield Jaro-Winkler
scores under the 0.875 threshold: “crabapple” (0.541), “affle” (0.760), “apfel” (0.827), “appollo”
(0.853), and even “epple” (0.867). Meanwhile, words that share initial characters or combinations
of characters with “apple” would trigger a Jaro-Winkler match at the 0.875 threshold — for example,
“snapple” (0.905), “appal” (0.907), and “bapple” (0.944).
 A rough study of opposition proceedings before the PTO’s Trademark Trial & Appeal Board
(TTAB) lends further support to the proposition that the 0.875 threshold is relatively conservative.
The TTAB maintains a dataset describing all of its opinions since November 1996. Final Decisions
of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, U.S. PAT. & TRADEMARK OFF., https://e-foia.
uspto.gov/Foia/TTABReadingRoom.jsp [https://perma.cc/R62N-5HJN] (last updated Nov. 2017).
We studied all 2587 opposition opinions included in this dataset from November 1996 through
December 2016. For each of these opinions, we calculated a Jaro-Winkler score that compared up
to the first four words in the opposer’s mark with up to the first four words in the applicant’s mark.
The mean Jaro-Winkler score for the 1587 oppositions we studied that were sustained at least in
part was 0.646, while the comparable score for the 932 oppositions we studied that were dismissed
992 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
the full mark (including disclaimed language) as the basis of our comparisons
with frequently used words and frequently occurring surnames.
Even when using this very conservative method of matching, we
find evidence of extreme word-mark depletion. Of the 86,408 words
listed in our word frequency table, 83,913 (97.1%) were confusingly similar
to an active trademark registration in 2016. These words account
for 89.1% of all word usage in American English. Of the 10,000 most
frequently used words, all but nine are confusingly similar to an alreadyregistered
mark.180 The degree of word-mark depletion is also severe
for many specific classes of goods and services. Figure 8 shows, for each
Nice class, the proportion of word usage that consists of words confusingly
similar to active trademark registrations in that class in 2016. By
this measure, over half of the Nice classes show word-mark depletion
amounting to over 70% of all word usage, with Class 9 (electronic goods,
including software) leading at 88.5% and Class 35 (business administration
services) at 87.8%.
Admittedly, because certain classes, such as Class 9 and Class 35,
cover a very broad range of goods or services, these data do not show
that all words identified as confusingly similar to an already-registered
mark in a particular class are unavailable in that class. When the marks
are merely similar rather than identical and the goods are sufficiently
different, it is possible that a registration will issue. At the very least,
however, these data indicate an enormous amount of friction in the registration
process for applicants seeking to register common English
words. They further show the considerable challenges entrants face in
finding a mark that will be distinctive in its product space in comparison
with other similar marks in that space.

at least in part was 0.601. These results suggest that a Jaro-Winkler threshold of 0.875 is highly
conservative. The TTAB dataset is very rich, and we plan further, more refined study of it. 180 These words were, in order of decreasing frequency: “vulnerable,” “unintelligible,” “unfortunate,”
“disappointment,” “uh-huh,” “vulnerability,” “would-be,” “unsuccessful,” and “notwithstanding.”

182 We do not currently study nonidentical matches for one-syllable words. The Jaro-Winkler
measure studies distance between alphabetic strings. We cannot use this measure on our onesyllable
word data, which are instead represented phonetically. In future work, however, we plan
to use our phonetic dataset representing all word marks to measure sound similarity, which is
harder, if not impossible, to do accurately with mere alphabetic representations of word marks.

using that word in another registered mark even within the same class
of goods or services. Nor will it necessarily impair the distinctiveness
of the word when used in other marks to the same degree that an already-existing
single-word mark might. It depends on the mark: for
example, there is a good chance that BLUE COMPUTERS would stop
nearly all other uses of the mark BLUE in Class 9, whereas BLUE
GRASS ELECTRONICS or HIGH-DEFINITION BLUE RAY COMPUTERS
are less likely to do so. Stated conservatively, there is an elevated
chance that the registration of a mark containing a word will have
restrictive effects on others’ use of that word, as compared with a world
with no such registration.
Therefore, data on within-mark uses of frequently used words in
American English offer additional evidence of the extent of word-mark
depletion, especially because an extraordinarily high proportion of word
usage in American English consists of words already claimed as part of
a live trademark registration.183 As Table 3 indicates, of the 1000 most
frequently used words, only three failed to appear within an active
trademark registration in 2016. These were “although,” “showed,” and
“seemed.” Of the 86,408 most frequently used words in American
English, 38,388 (or 44.4%) appeared somewhere within an active trademark
registration in 2016. These 38,388 words account for 86.7% of all
word usage in American English.

Figure 10 shows, for each Nice class of goods and services, the proportion
of word usage consisting of words claimed within trademarks in
that class in 2016. Particularly high levels of depletion by this measure
appear in Classes 9 (electronic goods), 16 (printed matter), 25 (apparel
goods), 35 (business administration services), 41 (education, entertainment,
and cultural and sporting activities), and 42 (computer-related
services). Over 80% of all word usage consists of words claimed within
marks in each of these classes.

183 Our within-mark matching protocol looked for the appearance of the word as a freestanding
word within the mark.
996 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
Within-mark coverage of surnames is also very high. Of the 1000
most frequently occurring surnames in the United States, covering
40.6% of the population, only eleven fail to appear as a word in a registration
active in 2016.
184 Of all of the 151,671 surnames listed in the
Census data, 38,122 appeared as a word in an active registration in 2016,
representing 70.2% of the U.S. population. Figure 10 shows high levels
of surname depletion — as measured by the proportion of the population
carrying a surname already claimed within a mark — in the same
classes that showed high levels of word-mark depletion. These data
suggest that, in effect, in Classes 9, 25, 35, and 41, half of the U.S. population
would face significant difficulties in seeking to register their surnames
as trademarks.
Finally, an extraordinarily high proportion of syllable usage is covered
by within-mark uses of one-syllable words consisting of any syllable
appearing in the Corpus of Contemporary American English. Of the
10,753 syllables appearing in the corpus, 7666 (70.7%) were claimed as
one-syllable words in active registrations in 2016. These 7666 syllables
account for 86.9% of all syllable usage in the corpus. Figure 10 shows
very high levels of syllable depletion across a wide variety of classes,
most notably in Classes 9, 25, and 35, where one-syllable words accounted
for 80.8%, 79.9%, and 81.1% of all syllable usage, respectively.
Across most Nice classes, it is highly unlikely that an entrant could use
a neologism consisting of a word whose corresponding syllable appears
in the corpus without encountering a strong possibility of a conflict with
an already-registered mark.

TLD is of course not divided into classes of goods and services; it allows
only one registrant of a domain name like “apple.” As a result, wordmark
depletion in this space can be extreme. Of the 86,408 most frequently
used words in English, 77,340 are currently registered as domain
names in the .com TLD. These 77,340 words represent 86% of all word
usage in American English.186 Of the 10,000 most frequently used
words of more than two characters, only four remain unregistered in the
.com top-level domain: “two-year” (with a frequency rank of 7012),
“four-year” (7479), “three-year” (8457), and “nineteenth-century” (8691).
Moreover, if one allows for the most minor of spelling variations, these
four words are indeed registered as twoyear.com, 4year.com,
threeyear.com, and nineteenthcentury.com, respectively. On this count,
not one of the 10,000 most frequently used words of more than two
characters remains unregistered.
Surname depletion in the .com TLD is even more extreme, bordering
on total. Of the 151,671 surnames listed in the U.S. Census data, all but
813 match a domain name listed in Verisign’s .COM TLD Zone File.187
In effect, at least 90% of the U.S. population carries a surname that has
already been claimed in the .com space — and because the U.S. Census
table lists only those surnames that appeared 100 or more times in the
Census data, the percentage is likely higher.
With respect to all letter combinations consisting of four characters
or fewer, all two-letter combinations are registered in the .com top-level
domain. According to the Verisign data, all but 36 of the 17,576 possible
three-letter combinations are registered under .com, and 99.7% of all
possible 456,976 four-letter combinations are registered under .com.188
The Verisign data do not indicate the proportion of .com domain
name registrations that are held by cybersquatters engaging purely in
rent-seeking. It may be that a high proportion of .com domain name
registrations are actively for sale. Still, the .com domain name data
provide further evidence of the enormous friction that entrants face in
developing a new brand name.

186 The words “a” and “I,” together accounting for 3.2% of all word usage in American English,
are not registered as domain names. See infra note 188 (explaining that no single-letter domain
names are currently registrable).
187 A random check of several of the 813 surnames that failed to find a match in Verisign’s data
suggest that Verisign’s dataset is incomplete. We reviewed the domain name registration status of
ten randomly chosen non-matching surnames at register.com and found that each surname had
already been claimed.
188 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has established special
rules for the reservation and eventual allocation of single-letter domain names, which are not currently

2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 999
In this section, we have presented evidence of word-mark depletion
based on what words are already registered. This evidence is stunning.
Even using a conservative similarity matching protocol, nearly all the
words we use on a daily basis are already registered or are confusingly
similar to an already-registered mark. The same is true with respect to
the surnames of a very high proportion of Americans. Even potential
neologisms show high levels of depletion. Across all classes, the evidence
shows increasing levels of depletion within each class, with certain important
classes experiencing especially severe depletion: Class 9 (electronic
goods), Class 25 (apparel goods), Class 35 (general business administration
services), Class 41 (education, entertainment, and cultural
and sporting activities services), and Class 42 (computer-related services).
The evidence is particularly compelling because we are studying
only registered marks. There is still the broad population of “common
law” marks that, though unregistered, nevertheless enjoy federal protection
and can preclude or severely limit new registrations that conflict
with them. We think this evidence alone confirms the popular wisdom
that market entrants now face enormous challenges in developing new
marks, challenges that substantially impede competition.189 The data
also help to explain emerging trends in applicant and registrant conduct,
to which we now turn.
C. Evidence of Word-Mark Depletion in Which Marks
Are Being Applied for and Registered
Even if a strikingly high proportion of frequently used words, surnames,
and short neologisms are already claimed as trademarks, it is
apparent that this has not prevented applicants from continuing to register
trademarks at the PTO. In 2016, for example, the PTO added
221,817 new registrations to the Principal Register, of which 93,060 were
single-word trademarks.
But the overall effectiveness and desirability of applied-for and registered
trademarks have been declining. Applicants have been moving
away from frequently used words and surnames and toward neologisms.
Left with fewer standard words from which to choose marks, firms are
constrained to settle for coined words, which tend to be less readily
memorable and more costly to imbue with meaning.190 They have also
been applying for longer marks, as measured by word count, syllable
count, and character length. Longer marks are generally more complex
and forgettable, making them less desirable than shorter marks.191 We
suggest that these trends are consistent with the effects of word-mark
depletion on the trademark system. With a high proportion of preferred

word marks already claimed, entrants are increasingly resorting to
second-best marks.
Figure 11 shows, by filing year, the increasing proportion of singleword
applications and registrations that consist of neologisms. For these
purposes, we count as a neologism any word not appearing in the Corpus
of Contemporary American English list of most frequently used
words or in the Census list of the most frequently occurring surnames
in the United States. For applications filed in 1985, 75.3% of all applications
for single-word marks and 77.2% of such applications that were
eventually registered consisted of neologisms. For all applications filed
in 2014, the percentage of neologisms had increased to 82.8% of singleword
applications and 84.3% of those that were registered. The data
show that this upward trend has been particularly pronounced in Class
25 (apparel goods). For applications filed in 1985, 62.5% of single-word
applications and 68.0% of those that were registered consisted of neologisms.
For applications filed in 2014, the percentage of neologisms had
increased to 82.0% of single-word applications and 85.7% of those that
were registered.
Figure 11: Proportion of Applications and Registrations
Consisting of Neologisms by Filing Year, 1985–2016
Figure 12 focuses on surnames and shows the declining proportion
over time of applications and registrations matching frequently occurring
surnames. For applications filed in 1985, 6.3% of applications and
6.2% of those that were registered consisted of a single word matching
a surname included in the Census list of the most frequently occurring
surnames in the United States. For applications filed in 2014, the percentages
had dropped to 3.5% of applications and 3.4% of those that
were registered.

Figure 13 shows the increasing length in word count of applied-for

goods). Consistent with Figure 13, applications for single-word marks
in particular have declined from a high of 47.1% of all word-mark applications
in 1985 to a low of 38.1% of all such applications in 2005 and
continuing at roughly that level through 2016. With respect to overall
word count, as Figure 13 indicates, the average word count of all applications
in 1985 was 1.94 words, and of all such applications that resulted
in registration, it was 1.86 words. For applications filed in 2014, these
averages had increased to 2.26 words for all applications and 2.23 words
for those that resulted in registration. Similarly, for apparel goods, average
word count increased from 2.00 words for applications filed in
1985 (and 1.94 words for those that resulted in registration) to 2.37
words for applications filed in 2014 (and 2.26 words for those that resulted

This evidence demonstrates that applicants themselves are increasingly
seeking marks from what marketing experts consider to be less
desirable categories: neologisms and longer words or phrases. We recognize
that these data do not provide conclusive evidence that applicants
across the trademark system are resorting to less-preferred marks
in an effort to cope with word-mark depletion. Other factors, such as
trends in marketing counter to those described in section I.B.2, may account
for applicants’ shift to neologisms or longer marks. Nevertheless,
it is striking that each of the trends described in Figures 11 through 15
is directionally consistent with the effects of word-mark depletion,
which we also demonstrate through the other data presented in this
Part.192
D. Evidence of Word-Mark Depletion in Applications
Failing to Succeed to Publication
We have sought to show that applicants are changing their conduct
in response to word-mark depletion: in an effort to avoid conflicts with
already-registered marks, they are increasingly applying for and ultimately
registering second-best marks. Yet notwithstanding applicants’
apparent efforts to avoid them, conflicts at the PTO have been increasing.
As discussed above, section 2(d) empowers the PTO to refuse to
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
192 We additionally investigated whether frequent applicants at the PTO applied for and registered
neologisms, surnames, and longer marks at rates different from those of infrequent applicants.
We found no substantial difference between frequent, infrequent, and single filers with respect to
the trends discussed in this section.

register marks that are likely to be confusingly similar to alreadyregistered
marks. From 2003 through 2014, an increasing proportion of
applications received a section 2(d) refusal — and an increasing proportion
of applications receiving a section 2(d) refusal ultimately failed to
succeed to publication.193 This is particularly compelling evidence of
word-mark depletion. As discussed above, applicants may now relatively
easily determine the existence of already-registered marks that
conflict with the marks they seek to register.194 Furthermore, applicants
appear to be acting on this knowledge by applying for neologisms and
longer marks.195 Yet the rate of section 2(d) refusals continues to increase.
Even while seeking to avoid conflicts, applicants still appear to
be increasingly encroaching upon already-claimed marks.196
Figure 16 shows the increasing proportion of applications containing
text that triggered at least one section 2(d) refusal. Section 2(d) refusal
rates in the apparel and beverages sectors have grown especially high;
for example, nearly one in five applications (19.8%) in the beverages
sector faced a section 2(d) refusal in 2014 as compared to 13.5% eleven
years prior.197
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
193 Although we have other PTO data on trademark applications and registrations dating back
longer, recall that we are able to collect data on section 2(d) refusals only from 2003 forward. See
supra p. 973. 194 See supra section I.C, pp. 970–72. 195 See supra section III.C, pp. 999–1003. 196 Some of these applicants might be relatively unsophisticated and not realize that there are
mark conflicts. Or some might be highly sophisticated applicants knowingly pushing the envelope
in an attempt to register rights in a questionably available mark.
197 Some classes, like Class 5 (pharmaceuticals), have lower rates of section 2(d) refusals. However,
even in these classes, there have been relatively similar increases in the proportion of section
2(d) refusals (from 9.8% in 2003 to 13.5% in 2014). We think there is an important reason, related
to FDA regulations, that pharmaceutical mark applications experience lower rates of section 2(d)
refusals, which we discuss below. See infra pp. 1038–39.

Even if an application receives a section 2(d) refusal, the applicant
may overcome that refusal by persuading the trademark examiner or
ultimately the PTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that there is
no likelihood of confusion.198 For applications filed from 2003 through
2014, about one-third of applications that received a section 2(d) refusal
managed to succeed to publication, though publication rates in this regard
have been slowly and steadily declining in recent years — from a
high of a 38.4% publication rate for such applications filed in 2007 to a
low of 34.9% for such applications filed in 2013. Overall, Figure 17
shows the increasing proportion of applications that both received a section
2(d) refusal and subsequently failed to publish.

Figure 17: Proportion of Applications Containing Text that Triggered a
Section 2(d) Refusal and Failed to Publish by Filing Year, 2003–2014
Consistent with the data above showing severe word-mark depletion
with respect to common words and surnames, applications for neologisms
tend to do better in avoiding section 2(d) refusals. Figure 18 shows
relevant trends over time. Specifically, it shows by filing year the proportion
of single-word applications that received a section 2(d) refusal
and then failed to publish where those applications consisted either of a
neologism or of a common word or common surname. By 2014, 15.5%
of single-word applications consisting of either a common word or a
common surname received a section 2(d) refusal and then failed to publish.
A far lower proportion of neologism applications (7.5%) did so.199
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
199 This difference might very well lie in a slower depletion rate for neologisms than for common
English words, which is unsurprising given that the former category is larger than the latter and
there are many marketing reasons why businesses prefer to choose marks from the latter category,
supra pp. 965–66. Yet our data show that both categories of word marks are increasingly being
depleted over time, see supra section III.B, pp. 981–99, and Figure 18’s upward-trending lines for
both non-neologisms and neologisms corroborate this.

Viewed from a different angle, the data indicate that if an application
has failed to succeed to publication, it is increasingly likely that it has
failed because of a section 2(d) conflict. Figure 20 focuses on applications
that failed to reach publication and shows the increasing proportion
of such applications that received at least one section 2(d) refusal.
This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in certain classes. In 2014,
a section 2(d) refusal was issued to over half of all applications that
failed to reach publication in Class 25 (apparel goods) and in Classes 32
and 33 (which together cover beverages).
Figure 20: Proportion of Applications Failing to Publish that Received
a Section 2(d) Refusal by Filing Year, 2003–2014
Overall, Figure 20 shows that for those applications failing to succeed
to publication, an increasing proportion are failing because they
conflict with an already-registered mark.200
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
200 These trends in section 2(d) refusal rates have likely been worsened by the expansion in recent
decades in the scope of protection the law affords to trademarks. Many scholars have remarked on
this expansion. See, e.g., Jessica Litman, Breakfast with Batman: The Public Interest in the Advertising
Age, 108 YALE L.J. 1717, 1721–25 (1999) (describing the expanding scope of trademark protection
in the second half of the twentieth century); see also Barton Beebe, Essay, Search and Persuasion
in Trademark Law, 103 MICH. L. REV. 2020, 2069–72 (2005) (discussing the rise of the
“[s]overeign [t]rademark,” id. at 2069). Indeed, more generally, this expansion in trademark scope
serves to accelerate trademark depletion and congestion and to worsen the severity of their impact
on competition and the public domain. We discuss possible reforms to the likelihood-of-confusion
standard in trademark law below. See infra p. 1041.

E. The Performance of Incumbent Applications at the PTO
One class of applicants continues to do well in the face of word-mark
depletion: those that apply based on already-owned registrations. Applicants
must identify whether an application is based on a previous
registration and indicate their ownership of that registration.201 Otherwise
that registration might form the basis of a refusal of the new application
under section 2(d).202 For example, a Korean company recently
applied for the word TRY in Class 25 (apparel goods).203 In doing so,
the company cited its prior registration of the word in stylized format in
the same class.204 This disclosure prevented the possibility of a section
2(d) refusal based on that prior registration. Over the twelve-year period
from 2003 through 2014,
205 13.1% of applications were based, like
the application for TRY, on one or more previous registrations.
During this period, incumbent applications enjoyed lower section
2(d) refusal rates, and when they did receive section 2(d) refusals, they
tended to be very successful in overcoming them. Overall, for the years
2003 through 2014, 10.5% of incumbent word-mark applications received
a section 2(d) refusal, and 78.8% of these applications overcame
that refusal and published. In contrast, 14.2% of nonincumbent applications
received a section 2(d) refusal and only 36.5% overcame the refusal
and published. More generally, over the same time period, incumbent
applications enjoyed a substantially higher publication rate, at
93.9%, than did nonincumbent applications, at 76.3%.
The particular characteristics of incumbent applications also show
the benefits of incumbency. The data indicate that incumbents are applying
for and registering non-neologisms at a higher rate than nonincumbents.
For the twelve-year period from 2003 through 2014, 32.4%
of all nonincumbent applications resorted to single-word neologisms as
compared to 23.4% of incumbent applications.206 If non-neologisms are
in many respects preferred as trademarks, incumbents are benefiting
further from having staked claims to these marks when they were still
available.
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
201 See 37 C.F.R. § 2.36 (2016). 202 See TMEP, supra note 55, § 812 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1052(d)). 203 TRY, Registration No. 4,610,405. 204 Id. (citing TRY, Registration No. 1,543,608). 205 In this section, we restrict our analysis to applications filed from 2003 to 2014. We begin in
2003 because section 2(d) refusal data are not available for applications filed before this date. We
end in 2014 because applications filed after this date may not have been fully processed by 2016,
which would skew the publication rate data for such applications.
206 This difference continues through to the proportion of applications filed from 2003 through
2014 that resulted in registration and that consisted of a single-word neologism. For nonincumbents,
34.6% of applications filed over this period that resulted in registration consisted of singleword
neologisms. For incumbents, it was 25.0%.
1010 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
The advantages of incumbency are also clear with respect to the
most frequently applied-for marks. Table 4 lists the twenty most frequently
applied-for word marks for the period 1985 through 2014, all of
which are standard English words. Taking ECLIPSE as an example,
Figure 21 shows the substantially higher publication rate for incumbent
applications for ECLIPSE as compared with nonincumbent applications.
Similar differences appear in specific classes.

between the number of times particular words were applied for from
1985 through 2014 and the average incumbent and nonincumbent publication
rates for all applications for those words. For example, for a
word applied for only once during this period, the publication rate for
all nonincumbent applications was 80.3%. By comparison, the publication
rate for incumbent applications for a word applied for only once
was 94.6%. Figure 22 shows that with respect to both incumbent and
nonincumbent applications, publication rates declined dramatically as a
word was applied for more frequently. In nearly all cases, however, the
publication rate for incumbent applications was substantially higher
than that for nonincumbent applications.

This Part has presented evidence showing both that word-mark depletion
is growing increasingly severe and that new applicants are altering
their conduct in an effort to adapt to this condition. Whatever the
conventional theoretical view may be on the inexhaustibility of good
trademarks, new applicants are revealing in their conduct a different
reality. They are increasingly shifting toward neologisms and longer,
more complex, and thus less effective, marks. Yet even these efforts are
increasingly failing. Section 2(d) refusal rates continue to rise, particularly
in certain classes. Only incumbents seem to be immune to the
effects of depletion. As we discuss more fully in Part V, the result is a

trademark system under serious stress, with mounting barriers to entry,
increasing consumer search costs, and an eroding public domain. First,
however, we turn to another dimension of the problem: trademark
congestion.
IV. WORD-MARK CONGESTION
Even if a word mark is already registered, this will not necessarily
preclude others from registering the same mark for use in connection
with other goods or services.207 For example, the registration for the
single-word mark ACE for adhesive bandages was issued in 1949 and
remains active.208 This registration did not prevent a different company
from registering the single-word mark ACE for hardware goods in
1985209 and then for hardware store services in 1987.
210 Section 2(d)
only bars the registration of marks that will confuse consumers as to
source due to the similarity of these marks with previously registered
marks; however, if the previously registered marks are used on unrelated
goods, confusion as to source is unlikely. Thus, marks may have multiple
different registrants in multiple different classes. This helps to explain
how, by 2016, there could be 130 different active single-word registrations
for ACE across the various Nice classes owned by
approximately ninety-five different registrants.211
Such parallel uses of word marks constitute word-mark congestion.
They impose significant costs on the trademark system in that parallel
uses blur the link in consumers’ minds between the mark and any particular
source among the many to which the mark refers. We explain
these costs in more detail in Part V. First, however, we illustrate in this
Part the extent of word-mark congestion. Section A outlines a framework
for evaluating congestion. Sections B, C, and D focus on the congestion
of common English words, common American surnames, and
potential one-syllable words, respectively.
A. A Framework for Evaluating Word-Mark Congestion
Word-mark congestion describes the process by which a word mark
that is already claimed is claimed by an increasing number of different
trademark owners. As with word-mark depletion, word-mark congestion
is best understood in two dimensions, in terms of the congestion of
(1) a set of marks with respect to (2) a set of goods or services. Congestion
occurs at the general level of all goods and services when different

firms in different classes of goods or services).

See ACE, Registration No. 131,017.
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 1013
entities each use the same mark but in different classes of goods or services
(for example, ACE for adhesive bandages and ACE for hardware
store services). Alternatively, and perhaps more troublingly, congestion
occurs at the more specific level of a particular class of goods or services
when different entities each use the same mark within that class. Congestion
as to all classes or a specific class can also be understood as
occurring with respect to a set consisting of one or multiple marks. For
example, as we report below, the set of the 1000 most frequently used
nouns and adjectives shows high degrees of congestion at the general
level of all classes of goods and services and indeed also at the level of
specific classes of goods or services.
At the level of either all goods and services or a specific class, the
new registration of a word mark causes either depletion or congestion,
but not both. To understand why this is so, consider the example of
class-specific congestion. If a business registers a word mark that no
one else has registered in a class, this causes depletion of the supply of
unclaimed word marks in the class. But it does not congest that mark
in the class because the mark has only one owner in that class. In contrast,
if a business registers a mark that another business has already
registered in the class, this does not cause depletion because that mark
is already depleted. Instead, the mark is congested in the class because
it now has more than one registrant in that class.
In essence, depletion is binary. A word mark either is or is not depleted
with respect to a class of goods or services. Congestion is continuous.
A word mark can become more congested in a class as it is
claimed by more and more registrants in that class.
Depletion and congestion are linked conceptually. Once a set of
words is entirely depleted with respect to a class, any subsequent claim
to a word in that set will necessarily increase congestion of that word.212
Therefore, congestion always follows complete depletion if marks continue
to be chosen from such a set of words.213 The connection can also
run in the other direction. Congestion can sometimes lead to marks
becoming completely unavailable. In particular, the more a mark is
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
212 This is mathematically true because each word in the set has already been claimed, so an
additional claim to a word in that set will be for a word that has already been claimed and will
thereby increase congestion for that word. Cf. Presh Talwalkar, 16 Fun Applications of the Pigeonhole
Principle, MIND YOUR DECISIONS (Nov. 25, 2008), http://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2008/
11/25/16-fun-applications-of-the-pigeonhole-principle/ [https://perma.cc/RV36-DLQM] (“The pigeonhole
principle states that if more than n pigeons are placed into n pigeonholes, some pigeonhole
must contain more than one pigeon.”).
213 For different sets of goods and services, a new registration can cause depletion and congestion
simultaneously in the following sense. If a particular word mark has not already been registered in
a particular class, the registration of that mark in that class will cause word-mark depletion with
respect to that class. At the same time, if another entity has already registered that mark in another
class of goods or services, the registration will cause congestion at the level of all classes of goods
and services taken together.
1014 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
congested — whether within a class or across classes — the more likely
it will eventually become unavailable for newer claimants even beyond
the particular goods and services for which it is already being used. We
think this is especially the case for marks with greater inherent distinctiveness
— particularly arbitrary or fanciful marks. That is because the
PTO’s rules make it easier to conclude that there is confusion with inherently
distinctive marks than with those that are not inherently distinctive.214
Finally, depletion and congestion are bound together with
regard to their costs, as we discuss below, because over time new applicants
increasingly face a catch-22 between exacerbating either depletion
or congestion.215
As we indicated above, congestion can occur even when section 2(d)
is being properly applied. The primary way in which it can occur is
when an applicant registers a mark for goods or services sufficiently
different from those for which the same mark is already registered that
consumers will not be confused as to source. A second way in which
congestion can occur applies to multi-word marks. Section 2(d) will
permit the registration of multi-word marks that contain words already
claimed in other marks provided that consumers will not be confused as
to source by the parallel uses of the particular words. For example, an
apparel company would likely be able to register BLUE LAGOON
FASHIONS even if another apparel company has already registered
FEELING BLUE DESIGNS. Both marks share the word BLUE, so
the second registration increases congestion of BLUE for apparel goods.
But it is probable that given the contexts in which BLUE is used by the
two businesses, consumers would not be confused as to source and no
section 2(d) refusal would issue.
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
214 See, e.g., TMEP, supra note 55, § 1207.01(b)(viii) (observing that “consumers would be more
likely to perceive a fanciful or arbitrary term, rather than a descriptive or generic term, as the
source-indicating feature of [a] mark,” giving it more weight in confusion analysis (citing In re Dixie
Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 1997))); id. § 1207.01(b)(ix) (“The Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board have recognized that merely descriptive
and weak designations may be entitled to a narrower scope of protection than an entirely
arbitrary or coined word.” (citing, inter alia, Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin
Maison Fondee en 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2005))). For the same reason, we suspect
that for less inherently distinctive marks, by contrast, such as geographic designations or prefixes
like “EZ,” the trademark system is more likely to tolerate substantially increasing levels of congestion
without rendering those marks unavailable.
215 See infra section V.A, pp. 1021–29. That applicants have to choose between increasing either
depletion or congestion has another implication: both depletion and congestion can increase in parallel
over time. Evidence of one will not undercut evidence of the other. Because some applicants
prefer to choose a mark that causes further depletion and others prefer to select a mark that causes
further congestion, overall depletion and congestion rates can both rise together.

B. Congestion of Frequently Used Words
To assess trends in the degree of congestion of common English
words, we focus on single-word registrations identically matching any
one of the 1000 most frequently used nouns or adjectives regardless of
Nice class.216 Figure 23 shows two trends from 1985 through 2016. The
bars (and the right axis) show by year the number of the 1000 most
frequently used nouns and adjectives that were the subject of one or
more active single-word registrations. The line (and the left axis) shows
by year the average number of different registrants for each such noun
or adjective.217 In 1985, 602 of the 1000 most common nouns or adjectives
were claimed by an average of 2.7 different registrants across the
various Nice classes. By 2016, conditions had changed substantially. Of
the 1000 most frequently used nouns or adjectives, 839 were claimed by
an average of 7.4 different registrants. We emphasize that these data
relate only to trademark registrations that identically matched the frequently
used word. The increase in parallel or near-parallel usage of
trademarks (PROGRAM and PROGRAMME, for example) by different
firms in the economy overall is likely substantially higher. Figure 23
suggests that the trademark system in general is becoming increasingly
congested with multiple firms using the same or very similar marks,
albeit on different goods or services.
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
216 We focus in this case on the 1000 most frequently used nouns and adjectives because the study
of parallel ownership of the 1000 most frequently used words including articles and verbs would
require enormous computational resources, particularly when we turn to the study of words appearing
within registered marks. Similarly, we recognize that extending our analysis to all 86,408
words in our list of standard English words (or at least all nouns and adjectives in that list) would
provide more precise information, but doing so would require even greater computational resources.
Our concern here is with general trends over time. We think a focus on the 1000 most frequently
used nouns and adjectives gives us significant insight into these trends. However, in future work,
we hope to develop a comprehensive analysis of trademark congestion with respect to all standard
English words.
217 In order to determine when registrations for identical marks were owned by different entities,
we compared entity names listed in the Trademark Case Files Dataset using a matching algorithm
based on a normalized Levenshtein edit distance rather than an algorithm based on identical matching.
This approximate matching was necessary because the data contained a significant number of
misspellings and slight changes in entity names; an identical-matching algorithm would thus result
in an overestimation of the number of parallel users and the degree of congestion. Our algorithm
employed the Stata module STRGROUP. See Julian Reif, STRGROUP: Stata Module to Match
Strings Based on Their Levenshtein Edit Distance, IDEAS, https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/
s457151.html [https://perma.cc/9DDE-3QN3]. We used what was for our purposes a very conservative
normalized Levenshtein edit distance of 0.40 (normalized to the length of the shorter string),
such that any two entity names that yielded a Levenshtein score below 0.40 would be counted as
matching and thus would not count as different registrants possessing parallel registrations of the
same mark.

Figure 24 shows the same two trends as Figure 23 but for the proportion
of the 1000 most frequently used nouns or adjectives that appeared
as words within an active registration and the degree of congestion
of these words. Evaluated by this metric, the increase in congestion
is staggering. In 1985, 961 of the 1000 most frequently used nouns or
adjectives appeared within registrations claimed by an average of 80.2
distinct registrants. By 2014, all 1000 such nouns or adjectives appeared
within registrations claimed by an average of 745.2 distinct registrants.

With respect to particular classes of goods and services, we would
expect to find substantially lower levels of congestion. This is because
section 2(d) will likely forestall or filter out applications for marks identical
to marks that are already registered when the applicant’s and the
registrant’s goods or services are related. Yet even with respect to particular
classes, we find increasing levels of congestion. Figure 25 shows,
for active registrations in 2016 identically matching any one of the 1000
most frequently used nouns or adjectives, the average number of different
registrants per word. Classes 9 (electronic goods) and 35 (general
business services) are very broad classes, so it is entirely possible that
two different companies could use the exact same single-word mark
within each class without creating consumer confusion. In that case, no
section 2(d) office action would issue. Class 25 (apparel goods) is more
narrowly defined, but the same may be true there as well. Even so, the
trends represented in Figure 25 suggest steadily increasing levels of congestion
within these classes.

Congestion is also significant with respect to surnames. Here, we
focus on single-word registrations identically matching any one of the
1000 most frequently occurring surnames regardless of Nice class. Just

two trends from 1985 through 2016. The bars show, by year, the number

of the 1000 most frequently used surnames that were the subject of one
or more active single-word registrations. The line shows, by year, the
average number of different registrants for each such surname. By 2016,
854 of the 1000 most frequently occurring surnames were claimed as
single-word trademarks by an average of 5.5 different registrants. As
with words, so with surnames: multiple registrants of the same surname
may not be confusing consumers as to source, but these parallel uses
result in substantial congestion.

As for uses of the same surname as a word within trademarks registered
by multiple different parties, the levels of congestion are extraordinarily
high, as Figure 27 shows. In 2016, of the 1000 most frequently

an average of 112.5 different registrants.

D. Congestion of One-Syllable Words
We also find significant evidence of congestion with respect to
identical-sounding one-syllable words including neologisms. Here, we
define congestion as the process by which increasing numbers of different
registrants have registered one-syllable marks that sound the same.
To gain some insight into this form of congestion, we focus on the 1000
most frequently used syllables in the Corpus of Contemporary American
English and the number of different registrants for words that sound
like those syllables. Figure 29 shows, by year, both the number of the
1000 most frequently used syllables that sounded the same as at least
one registered mark and the average number of different registrants of
words matching each syllable. In 1985, 545 of the 1000 most frequently
used syllables sound-matched at least one registered mark and each of
these 545 syllables sound-matched words registered by an average of 7.7
different registrants. By 2016, 758 syllables sound-matched registered
marks owned by an average of 18.0 different registrants.218

In sum, the data show that even as word-mark depletion has been
rising to severe levels, word-mark congestion has been rising as well.
Registrants are increasingly engaging in parallel uses of the same mark,
not only across classes, where congestion has reached extraordinary levels
for the words, surnames, and syllables studied, but also within classes.
We now turn in earnest to a consideration of the damage that both
of these trends are inflicting on the trademark system.
V. LEGAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF WORD-MARK
DEPLETION AND CONGESTION
Having demonstrated that word-mark depletion and congestion
have both been steadily increasing and have long since reached substantial
levels, we now examine, in section A, the costs of depletion and
congestion and, in section B, what policies may be pursued to minimize
these costs.
A. The Costs of Word-Mark Depletion and Congestion
The harms of depletion and congestion are in many ways
interrelated.219 For purposes of exposition, however, we first focus on
the costs of word-mark depletion in section 1, and then focus on the
costs of word-mark congestion in section 2.
1. The Costs of Word-Mark Depletion. — As we stated above, the
twin purposes of trademark law are to promote efficient and fair competition
and to minimize consumer search costs.220 Trademark depletion
subverts both of these purposes. It also represents a significant hazard
to the public domain. We turn first to the harms that depletion inflicts
on competition.
The anticompetitive effects of depletion take several forms. First, as
depletion worsens, entrants face higher costs than incumbents had faced
earlier when devising a mark that is both competitively effective and
also not confusingly similar to an already-registered mark. Media reports
across a variety of industries — including beer, music, and cosmetics
— confirm that these costs are substantial and represent a significant
barrier to entry.221 Our data show that it is becoming increasingly
difficult even to develop neologisms that are free of conflicts with
already-registered marks.222 Second, entrants are generally forced to
settle for less effective marks, and empirical studies show that, all else
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
219 We discuss a number of these important interrelationships above at pp. 1013–14. 220 See supra Part I, pp. 954–72 (invoking these goals in the context of describing trademark law
and practice).
221 See supra pp. 948–50. 222 See supra section III.B.1.c, pp. 987–90.
1022 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
equal, firms with less effective marks have less success in the marketplace
than those with more effective marks.223 As depletion has increased,
applicants have been shifting away from common English
words and American surnames and toward longer and more complex
marks, and even then, they are facing higher section 2(d) refusal rates.224
Third, having registered their mark in a particular class of goods or
services, incumbents may more easily leverage that registration into new
registrations within that class or in other classes.225 New entrants do
not enjoy this advantage. The data suggest that incumbent applications
benefit from substantially higher publication rates than new applicants
largely because incumbents have already established their rights in increasingly
depleted spaces.226 Fourth and finally, as more and more
common words, surnames, and short neologisms are claimed as trademarks,
so more and more trademark owners have sought to control —
and have often succeeded in controlling — others’ use of these terms
even when these uses are not confusing as to source. For example,
Entrepreneur Media has spent over ten years seeking to prevent all uses
of the word ENTREPRENEUR with regard to media goods and services
addressing small businesses, even when the term is being used descriptively
to specify the characteristics of the relevant goods or services
rather than as a source signifier.227 The ENTREPRENEUR example
is not unique. Trademark scholars have documented similarly unreasonable
conduct by many trademark owners.228
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
223 See sources cited supra note 85 and accompanying text. 224 See supra sections III.C–III.E, pp. 999–1012. 225 See supra section III.E, pp. 1009–12. 226 Our data do not show whether newer businesses are trying to overcome congestion or depletion
by licensing more desirable, but already claimed, marks from preexisting businesses that have
rights in those marks. Such private ordering might limit somewhat the anticompetitive advantages
of incumbency. However, we are skeptical that this private ordering is occurring on any significant
scale because, as a general matter, existing firms have incentives not to license their marks to producers
of competing goods or services. See Jeanne C. Fromer, The Unregulated Certification
Mark(et), 69 STAN. L. REV. 121, 129–30 (2017) (observing that, in contrast to the requirement that
certification marks be compulsorily licensed to any business meeting the certifier’s certification
standard, trademarks generally need not be, and for good reason might not be, licensed to third
parties).
227 Leah Chan Grinvald, Shaming Trademark Bullies, 2011 WIS. L. REV. 625, 644 (citing Amy
Zipkin, Entrepreneurs Must Choose Their Words with Care, N.Y. TIMES (Oct. 7, 2004), https://
nyti.ms/2hID8VC [https://perma.cc/4HH9-JTLN]). Trademark law typically allows third parties to
make descriptive uses of words that others have registered as trademarks. Otherwise, markholders
could undercut efficient competition by monopolizing words needed to describe relevant goods or
services. See 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4) (2012) (providing a statutory fair-use defense against trademark
infringement when a defendant uses a term or device “otherwise than as a mark . . . [if the term or
device] is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of
such party, or their geographic origin”); New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ’g, Inc., 971 F.2d

as “the enforcement of an unreasonable interpretation by a large corporation of its trademark rights
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 1023
In the face of the anticompetitive costs of depletion, two arguments
are typically adduced in defense of the conventional wisdom that the
supply of trademarks is inexhaustible and thus that depletion should
never be a problem. The first is that applicants can always resort to
neologisms.229 We do not, however, see neologisms as a solution to the
problem of depletion for three reasons. First, the data show that even
the supply of potential neologisms that are at least minimally competitively
effective — in that they are short, easily pronounced, and euphonic
— is being increasingly depleted.230 Second, while neologisms
may make sense in some economic sectors, they are less effective in others.
Particularly when new businesses wish to convey authenticity and
familiarity, neologisms are not optimal.231 Third and perhaps most importantly,
developing coined words into meaningful commercial symbols
for consumers is significantly more costly than familiarizing consumers
with noncoined words.232 This added cost represents a heavy financial
burden on market entrants, particularly when their incumbent competitors
might have been able, by virtue of having started their businesses
earlier, to choose then-available (noncoined) marks that were and remain
cheaper to promote.
A second defense of the conventional wisdom is that even if depletion
is continuing (and even if neologisms are not a solution), there is no
evidence that depletion has reached any kind of critical stage in which
competition is being substantially impaired.233 After all, new firms are
still finding trademarks to register and are still managing to compete.
But an insidious quality of depletion is that it proceeds gradually, and
even though its pace has quickened in recent years, it remains a chronic
rather than acute condition. We should expect no tipping point or moment
of crisis in which there are suddenly no trademarks left at all and
competition grinds to a halt. Instead, we should expect what the data
report: a continuous process in which individual applicants are still able

to find usable marks, but at ever-greater cost in pursuit of ever-less benefit.234
There will no doubt remain counterexamples, particularly in the
form of new, superstar brands, that suggest through saliency bias that
everything is fine. For example, if our only evidence is anecdotes from
the world of ride-sharing apps with apparently highly effective names
like UBER and LYFT, then we will remain insensitive to the severity of
depletion. Nonetheless, we feel confident extrapolating from the extensive
data reported in Part III that the overall population of new marks
will continue to decline in effectiveness.
In addition to gradually damaging competition, trademark depletion
also increases consumer search costs — and in a similarly gradual way.
Consumers’ ability to quickly link a mark with the source and qualities
it is intended to represent is directly related to how memorable the mark
is to consumers.235 As depletion increases, so does trademark length,
complexity, and bulkiness. Consumers must cope with less efficient
marks. Furthermore, as an increasing number of similar trademarks
occupy the same class of goods or services and registrants fill in whatever
unoccupied spaces are left, that class begins to take on the characteristics
of a “crowded field”236 of trademarks — or of a “trademark
thicket.”237 In the infringement analysis, courts have long recognized
that certain areas of trademark usage are heavily populated with closely
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
234 See supra Part III, pp. 977–1012. 235 See supra pp. 954–55 (discussing the role of consumer search costs in trademark law). 236 See 2 MCCARTHY, supra note 22, § 11:85, at 11-268 to-73 (discussing “crowded field[s]” in
trademark law); see also Miss World (UK) Ltd. v. Mrs. Am. Pageants, Inc., 856 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th
Cir. 1988) (“We view the beauty pageant industry’s marks as a ‘crowded field’: In a ‘“crowded”
field of similar marks, each member of the crowd is relatively “weak” in its ability to prevent use
by others in the crowd.’ Simply put, ‘a mark which is hemmed in on all sides by similar marks on
similar goods cannot be very “distinctive.” It is merely one of a crowd of marks.’” (citation omitted)
(quoting 1 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, TRADEMARK AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW § 11:26, at
511 (2d ed. 1984))). 237 A trademark thicket is analogous in some ways to the patent thicket, a crowded area of patent
rights, in which rights to the many patents comprising the thicket must be secured for freedom of
operation in the space, which can raise cost issues and anticompetitive concerns. See, e.g., Dan L.
Burk & Mark A. Lemley, Policy Levers in Patent Law, 89 VA. L. REV. 1575, 1614–15, 1627, 1694–

similar marks.238 The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has recognized
the same in the section 2(d) analysis.239 A crowded field tends to
militate against a finding of likelihood of confusion because the assumption
is that “customers will not likely be confused between any two of
the crowd and may have learned to carefully pick out one from the
other.”240 This may well be true (or not), but consumers’ efforts in this
regard represent increased search costs, precisely the kinds of costs that
trademark law is designed to minimize, and for good reason.241 The
result of the “crowded field” doctrine is that such fields are allowed to
become even more depleted and even more crowded.
A final, albeit more amorphous, cost of trademark depletion is to the
noncommercial public domain, and more specifically to the free use of
the English language. Three-quarters of our word usage consists of
words registered as marks and almost nine-tenths consists of words confusingly
similar to registered marks.242 In such a situation, we use all
of our language in the shadow of trademark rights. To be sure, trademark
law allows noncommercial, nonconfusing uses of terms claimed by
others as trademarks. Fox News, for example, failed when it sought to
force Al Franken and his publisher to remove the phrase “fair and balanced”
from the book entitled Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them:

as well resourced as Franken’s publisher and even when they are, they
may be unwilling to expend the resources necessary to defend against
even the most frivolous suits, such as Fox News’s.244 The result is that
trademark law can often be used as a weapon in what amounts to an
“assault on cultural expression and free speech.”245 Indeed, this worry
appeared to form the basis of the widely negative public reaction to the
PTO’s recent publication of the trademark application for the word REACT
by the YouTube duo creating and distributing videos of different
groups of people reacting to anything and everything ranging from old
technologies to video games.246 As more and more commonly used
words and expressions are registered as trademarks by more and more
owners, we can expect this condition only to worsen.
2. The Costs of Word-Mark Congestion. — The costs of trademark
congestion are subtler than the costs of trademark depletion, but no less
important. These costs take two forms.
First, parallel uses increase consumer search costs. Even when they
do not confuse consumers as to source, parallel uses of the same mark
diminish the mark’s distinctiveness of source. They do so in the sense
that parallel uses blur the link between the mark and any one source.
Upon exposure to the mark, consumers who are aware that the same
mark comes from multiple sources must at the very least “think for a
moment”247 before linking the mark with one of those multiple sources.
In other words, parallel uses cause something akin to “dilution by blurring.”248
Federal trademark law provides a cause of action against conduct
that causes dilution by blurring and also lists it as a basis for third
parties to oppose the registration of a mark after it has been published.249
But in both cases, only “famous” marks qualify for antiblurring
protection.250 In this sense, the law’s concern with blurring would

appear to be misdirected. What little empirical evidence we have on the
matter suggests that famous marks are so strong as to be immune
to blurring.251 Instead, the harm of parallel uses arguably affects nonfamous
marks much more severely. As trademark congestion intensifies,
new market entrants that seek to use a mark already in use by others
face ever greater difficulties in establishing a link in consumers’ minds
between their mark and their source. This constitutes a raised barrier
to entry. At the same time, consumers faced with an increasingly congested
marketplace find it more difficult to disambiguate marks, particularly
those that are nonfamous or new. Consider the example of the
word mark ACE. In 2016, four new single-word registrations for ACE
were issued to four new registrants, each using the mark in a different
class.252 With 126 ACE registrations preceding them, two of which (one
for adhesive bandages and another for hardware services) are very well
known,253 these market entrants will face considerable challenges in establishing
an effective link in consumers’ minds between their marks
and their respective sources.254
The pharmaceutical sector offers a concrete example of this sort of
harm from congestion. For pharmaceutical products, trademark congestion
can literally kill. If different drugs with distinct effects have the
same name, or names that are too similar, doctors or pharmacists
may inadvertently substitute one for the other with potentially lethal
consequences.255 In fact, between eight and twenty-five percent of

focuses on nonfamous marks. We suggest that such marks, particularly when used by market entrants,
may suffer significant impairment from parallel uses.

medication errors are attributed to name confusion.256 For example, it
is not hard to see how, as one commentator notes, “[p]atients can wind
up taking the wrong prescription if a pharmacist mistakes Foradil,
which treats bronchitis, for Toradol, which relieves pain from arthritis,
or mixes up the blood-thinner Plavix with the antidepressant Paxil.”257
As we discuss further below, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has taken important steps to alleviate congestion in drug marks, from
which trademark law can more generally learn.258
The second cost to the trademark system of parallel uses is more
subtle. Consider the example of BLUE LAGOON FASHIONS and
FEELING BLUE DESIGNS. Assuming both marks are used in full,
their parallel uses of the word BLUE would not likely increase search
costs. A consumer can rely on the other words in the marks to establish
the link between the marks and their sources. Yet the parallel uses of
the word BLUE still impose a cost. This cost takes the form of harm to
the distinctiveness of both marks as against all other marks. Their
shared use of the word BLUE makes each mark less exceptional. From
a marketing perspective, each mark is less unique. And if many entities
in the apparel sector begin to incorporate the word BLUE into their
marks, the marketing power of all of these marks may be severely diminished.259

259 In many ways, the loss of distinctiveness caused by congestion is comparable to the loss of
distinctiveness caused by genericide. Genericide is the process by which a mark loses distinctiveness
of a particular source, when it becomes the primary way that consumers and competitors refer to a
genus of goods, and to all species of goods within that genus. Marks anywhere along the spectrum
of distinctiveness, be they descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful, see section I.A.1, pp. 957–
58, can become so congested as to become generic. Congestion represents one of the primary processes
through which marks lose distinctiveness to such an extent that they become generic. Genericide
is congestion taken to its extreme.
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 1029
been claimed, the entrant is forced either to choose a less desirable word
or words (from the same set or another set of words) or to seek to use
an already-claimed word in parallel with other entities’ usages.260 Later
entrants thus are necessarily disadvantaged compared with earlier ones.
Because they arrive on the scene later in time, they are more likely to
have to claim less-than-optimal marks: either marks further down on
their priority list of unclaimed marks in that trademark space or marks
that are already being used in the same trademark space by others but
that are permissible to claim in parallel. Neither will be as helpful as
an entrant’s ideal choice. It will be a less effective signifier, either because
it is a less memorable, pronounceable, or meaningful mark for
that good or service, or because it will be used in parallel with others
using the same mark. Either choice will contribute yet further to depletion
or congestion.
B. Adapting Trademark Law
Having illustrated the extraordinary degree of word-mark depletion
and congestion in the trademark system and evaluated their costs, we
now consider a number of policy levers available in trademark law that
may be used to reduce depletion and congestion and minimize their negative
effects.261 We discuss some of our preferred policy levers in depth
to exemplify the effects of our suggested changes. We also address how
the data we have gathered and analyzed can itself play an important
role in adapting trademark law to the challenges posed by depletion and
congestion.
Before turning to particular policy levers, however, it is important
first to recognize that trademark policymakers may take two alternative
overarching approaches to the problem of depletion and congestion.
One approach is to adopt across-the-board reforms that apply to all sets
of marks and classes of goods and services regardless of their particular
degrees of depletion or congestion. A uniform approach would have the
benefit of ease of application.262 Decisionmakers would not be required
to determine what kind or degree of depletion or congestion is necessary
before particular reforms kick in. A one-size-fits-all approach offers another
advantage: it would apply even to areas where there is little to no
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
260 The policies undergirding trademark law might counsel in favor of choosing, as a systematic
matter, worsening depletion over worsening congestion, or vice versa. The question is an interesting
one but lies beyond this Article’s scope.

the trademark register to improve the trademark system).

L. REV. 231, 232–33 (2014) (observing that “[i]ntellectual property systems all over the world are
modeled on a one-size-fits-all principle,” id. at 232, which makes them “easy to administer,” id. at
233).
1030 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
depletion or congestion. This could help to forestall the advance of depletion
and congestion in areas where they have not yet reached chronic
levels. Yet this approach also raises concerns. Uniform policies might
prove costly if they result in making more effective marks less available
even in non-depleted and uncongested areas, thereby undermining competition
and consumer protection.263
An alternative approach is to adopt tailored reforms that operate
more strictly precisely in those areas that are undergoing depletion or
congestion and to the degree that they are doing so. Targeted reforms
may involve the same substantive legal changes as those pursued in the
uniform approach, but only proportionately to the degree of depletion
or congestion in a particular class, subclass, or other area of trademark
use.
It is further important to recognize that whatever reforms are
adopted, they must take account of the fact that there are already over
two million currently active trademark registrations. Reforms must not
inefficiently and unfairly benefit incumbent registrants over entrants.
Imposing prospective rules that simply make it more difficult to register
new marks (or a subset of new marks) could exacerbate depletion and
its anticompetitive effects by further raising barriers to entry.264 For this
reason, any package of policy reforms must be directed toward both
current registrations and new applications.265
With these preliminaries in mind, we now outline a mix of reforms
that would help to mitigate depletion and congestion, discussing first
reforms directed primarily toward current registrants who wish to maintain
their rights in certain marks and then reforms directed toward applicants
who wish to claim rights in certain marks. Finally, we consider
reforms that bear upon the litigation context.
To alleviate depletion and congestion caused by current registrants,
we think it would be beneficial, straightforward, and administrable for
the PTO to increase maintenance and renewal fees. These fees are extremely
low: $100 per class each decade (though twice in the first decade
of registration) to attest to continued use of the trademark and as little
as $300 per class each decade to renew the registration.266 By imposing
greater financial — and perhaps also administrative — burdens on registrants
to maintain their registrations, increased fees may improve the

cost to society. Specifically, it forces society to pay an excessive price for the production of intellectual
assets.”).
264 See supra section V.A, pp. 1021–29 (discussing the harms depletion and congestion cause for
new entrants, as compared with earlier rightsholders).
265 Cf. Tushnet, supra note 77, at 918 (“We should register fewer marks and cancel more.”). 266 37 C.F.R. § 2.6(a)(5), (12) (2016); see also Keeping Your Registration Alive, USPTO, https://

likelihood that registered marks will be released back into the wild by
registrants who calculate that it is no longer cost-beneficial to maintain
certain registrations.267 Moreover, even when trademark owners choose
to pay increased fees and thereby to retain registered rights in their
marks, they would be better internalizing the costs their contribution to
depletion or congestion is imposing on the trademark system and the
public domain.
Current maintenance and renewal fees are uniform regardless of the
registrant’s and registered mark’s characteristics and the degree of depletion
or congestion in the mark’s class. We think it would be administratively
simplest to increase these fees equally across the board. Yet
as discussed above, doing so would impose on all mark owners an
equally increased financial burden regardless of whether their marks are
contributing to depletion or congestion.268 Still, this burden might nonetheless
be justified given how low these fees currently are and the general
benefits of raising the probability that good marks are freed up for
new entrants. It might also be costly to differentiate between markholders
that should pay an increased fee and those that should not.
Alternatively, the PTO could increase fees in a more targeted fashion
to force only those firms operating in particularly depleted or congested
areas to bear more of the costs that their trademark choices impose on
others269: the higher the degree of depletion or congestion in a particular
area, the higher the fee. Such targeted increases would impose a form
of “congestion pricing,” sometimes also called “peak pricing,”270 to ensure
that registrants in especially depleted or congested areas internalize
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
267 Analogous proposals have been made with regard to patent maintenance fees as a way to
release insufficiently valuable patents into the public domain. See Kimberly A. Moore, Worthless
Patents, 20 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1521 (2005) (studying maintenance of patents through relatively
heftier maintenance fees, and finding that over half of patents issued in 1991 were allowed to expire
when patentees failed to pay these fees, id. at 1530); see also Michael W. Carroll, One for All: The
Problem of Uniformity Cost in Intellectual Property Law, 55 AM. U. L. REV. 845, 882 (2006) (“By
conditioning protection on payment of maintenance fees, the Patent Act forces the patent owner
periodically to place an option value on continued protection and to reveal something about that
valuation. A patent owner’s decision not to pay the relatively modest maintenance fees is a decision
to dedicate the invention to the public domain.”).
268 See supra p. 1030. 269 See supra p. 1030. 270 Congestion pricing compels users of a resource to internalize some or all of the negative externalities
their use imposes on others. It thereby encourages users to act in ways that may decrease
congestion (for example, by shifting their use of a resource to times when it is not congested or by
making a more efficient use of the resource). Congestion-pricing schemes have been especially
successful in minimizing traffic congestion. See generally Jonathan Remy Nash, Economic Efficiency
Versus Public Choice: The Case of Property Rights in Road Traffic Management, 49 B.C. L.
REV. 673, 694–739 (2008) (analyzing the economic advantages of congestion pricing over building

1032 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
some of the costs that they are imposing on the trademark system by
adding to that depletion or congestion.271 Congestion pricing might also
dissuade firms from adopting marks that would significantly increase
depletion and congestion.272 The advantage of targeted reform is that,
ideally, it intervenes only where necessary. The disadvantage, however,
is that it requires a considerable degree of expertise and oversight by
policymakers to choose the appropriate threshold conditions for congestion
pricing.273 Another concern for a congestion-pricing scheme is the
regressive effect of its imposition of the same level of fees on entities of
differing sizes and levels of market power,274 something particularly
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
 Congestion pricing makes sense as a means of minimizing both trademark congestion and
trademark depletion. The link between congestion pricing and trademark congestion is straightforward.
With respect to trademark depletion, the analogy to traffic congestion is that depletion
causes increasing numbers of words in particular categories to be used as marks.
 There is another important link between congestion pricing for traffic and for trademark
registrations. The traditional approach to traffic congestion has involved generating additional
roadway capacity, which then tends to become equally or more congested, thereby not solving and
sometimes worsening the problem of congestion. Building new roads does not work. Id. at 694–
704. Similarly, while it is often imagined that a reliance on neologisms will solve the problems of
depletion and congestion, we do not see neologisms as an adequate solution, as we explain above.
See supra p. 1023.

2005). 271 Cf. Charles Komanoff, Pollution Taxes for Roadway Transportation, 12 PACE ENVTL. L. REV.
121, 132 (1994) (“The microeconomic rationale [for congestion pricing] is that although drivers endure
their own lost time from congestion, they are not charged for the delay costs they create for
others. The result . . . is that individual drivers continue to enter a roadway, even when the average
total cost of their arrival on the roadway exceeds the average benefit of using it. These delay costs
can be enormous.” (footnote omitted)); Nash, supra note 270, at 725 (“[C]ongestion gives rise to an
externality because drivers internalize only their own costs, rather than society’s actual costs. Congestion
pricing regimes endeavor to remedy this situation by requiring drivers to internalize the
costs that otherwise would be externalized.” (footnotes omitted)).
272 Cf. Nash, supra note 270, at 725 (emphasizing that congestion pricing “reduces uneconomic
overuse of roads”); Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, How Changes in Property Regimes Influence Social
Norms: Commodifying California’s Carpool Lanes, 75 IND. L.J. 1231, 1243–44 (2000) (“Current policy
[without congestion pricing] ma[kes] no distinction between those who value[] their time very
highly and those with lower valuations — traffic congestion affect[s] all commuters on a road
equally, regardless of differentials in how desperately they need[] to reach their destinations. Congestion
pricing was a scheme developed . . . to help correct these inefficiencies.” (footnotes omitted)).
273 As explained with regard to roadway traffic congestion, “[h]ow much to charge under congestion
pricing would depend on the extent to which drivers would respond to the higher price to drive.
This would depend on the availability and attractiveness of alternative modes, the value placed on
peak-period driving, and how much congestion society wishes to eliminate.” Komanoff, supra note
271, at 132. 274 See Nash, supra note 270, at 727 (“An . . . equity-related point is the perceived distributional
impact of a congestion-pricing regime. The burden of a congestion pricing regime might be seen to
fall heavily on poorer people. In other words, the regime might be characterized as a regressive
tax.” (footnotes omitted)); cf. Strahilevitz, supra note 272, at 1245–46 (“If all vehicles of the same
type are charged the same tolls during the same periods, these tolls will constitute a more significant
impediment to travel for those who have less income to spare.” Id. at 1245 (footnotes omitted).).
2018] ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TRADEMARKS? 1033
troubling here if the aim is to lower barriers to entry in ways that help
competition and consumers, not to raise those barriers further. Generally,
there are ways to correct for this effect, such as by using congestionpricing
revenues to pay for services benefiting small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs).275 This approach might be adapted to trademark
fees, for example, by setting fees lower for SMEs or by channeling increased
revenues toward SME business development.276
While closely targeted fee increases would help force entities to internalize
some of the costs of conduct contributing to depletion and congestion,
it is difficult to imagine, given administrative and political realities,
that a finely tuned scheme could work in practice. Policymakers
would have to decide how much depletion or congestion is too much,
how different degrees of one or the other would correspond to prices,
and which types and categories of depletion and congestion (such as for
common words or for shorter words) ought to matter. While it is an
admirable goal, we are not yet convinced it is practically viable. More
realistic might be a form of tiered pricing, with a limited number of tiers
painted with a broader brush, for different degrees or categories of depletion
and congestion.277
Another important policy lever directed toward current registrants
that the PTO should adjust is the use requirement in trademark law,
which should be tightened and more strictly enforced. As noted above,
American trademark law affords protection only to marks that are used
in commerce in connection with particular goods or services.278 The
requirement preserves the constitutional basis for Congress’s authority
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
275 Cf. Strahilevitz, supra note 272, at 1246. 276 Analogously, in its recent trademark fee increases, the European Union has sought to avoid
the regressive effect of congestion pricing by keeping prices down for options likely to be chosen by
SMEs. See infra note 277. 277 Recently, the European Union increased trademark fees with a tiered approach as a way to
accomplish analogous goals. See Regulation (EU) 2015/2424, of the European Parliament and of
the Council, 2015 O.J. (L 341) 21, 34. It implemented “a fee structure where a separate ‘class’ fee
is paid for each additional product class applied for beyond the first” class (whereas it had previously
required an extra fee for each additional product class only beyond the third class). European
Commission Press Release MEMO/15/4824, Package to Modernise the European Trade Mark System
— Frequently Asked Questions (Apr. 21, 2015), http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO15-4824_en.htm
[https://perma.cc/KP3L-TTFL]. The fee increase had multiple goals. First, this
change sought to lower registration fees for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which would pay
less for application and renewal if registering a mark in only one class. Id. (“The agreed changes
will allow in particular businesses that seek to prolong protection of their registered European
Union trade marks beyond an initial period of 10 years to benefit from savings up to 37%.”). More
relevantly, by charging applicants differently whether they file for one, two, three, or more classes,
the hope has been that “it will help to reduce the potential of congestion of the EU trade mark
register by diminishing broad claims for goods and services not really required by the trade mark
proprietor, and ensure a more balanced and harmonious trade mark system overall.” Id. 278 See supra note 32. For a discussion of the precise nature of the use requirement, see Stacey

to enact trademark law pursuant to the Commerce Clause.279 It also
helps ensure that trademark rights are granted in words or other symbols
only when they are affixed or associated with goods or services in
a way that will promote the goals of efficient competition and consumer
protection.280
The PTO has already begun to move in the direction of seeking to
declutter the register through the cancellation of marks not in use. In
2012, the PTO instituted a two-year pilot program that randomly audited
a sample of trademark registrations to determine if they actually
met the statutory requirement of use with respect to all or even any of
the goods or services specified in the registration.281 The PTO justified
the program out of concern that the trademark register was cluttered
with unused marks that new entrants might otherwise wish to adopt, a
concern that aligns with the harms caused by depletion and congestion:
The accuracy of the trademark register as a reflection of marks that are
actually in use in the United States for the goods/services identified in the
registration serves an important purpose for the public. The public relies
on the register to clear trademarks that they may wish to adopt or are already
using. Where a party searching the register uncovers a similar mark,
registered for goods or services that may result in confusion of consumers,
that party may incur a variety of resulting costs and burdens, such as changing
plans to avoid use of the mark, investigative costs to determine how the
similar mark is actually used and assess the nature of any conflict, or cancellation
proceedings or other litigation to resolve a dispute over the mark.
If a registered mark is not actually in use in the United States, or is not in
use on all the goods/services recited in the registration, these types of costs
and burdens may be incurred unnecessarily. Thus, accuracy and reliability
of the trademark register help avoid such needless costs and burdens, and
thereby benefit the public.282
At the conclusion of the two-year pilot period, the PTO reported the
results of the audit program.283 Of the 500 audited registrations, approximately
half could not be verified as being in use as claimed.284 As

a result, 16% of the audited registrations were cancelled and an additional
34% were amended to narrow the registration’s specification of
the goods or services in connection with which the registered mark was
claimed to be used.285 In light of the significant proportion of “deadwood”286
registrations that the pilot program revealed, the PTO has recently
finalized a rule change that makes its auditing efforts permanent.
Under the rule, the PTO will each year randomly audit up to 10% of
continuing-use affidavits filed that year “in which the mark is registered
for more than one good or service per class.”287
Our findings very strongly support the continuation and intensification
of the PTO’s auditing efforts. Indeed, our findings suggest that the
PTO should focus its efforts on those areas of the trademark system that
are most in need of clearing, namely, areas with high levels of depletion
or congestion. Assuming that the pilot sample is representative of the
Principal Register, a staggering number of registrations either ought to
be removed from the register or are overbroad. Clearing out these unused
marks not only helps ensure the register’s integrity288 but also decreases
depletion and congestion by making unused — and likely desirable
— marks available for reuse by new entrants. In fact, the PTO
could make the use requirement more muscular in additional ways. For
example, the PTO could provide a streamlined process for third parties

PTO is currently considering.290
Because of the harms that depletion and congestion inflict, we also
advocate that the PTO be more cautious, as Rebecca Tushnet otherwise
advocates, in granting incontestability to registered marks.291 Trademark
law allows a registered mark in continuous use for five years following
registration to become incontestable, so long as certain conditions

are met, such as the absence of a final decision adverse to the mark’s
continuing registration.292 Once a mark achieves incontestable status,
it is susceptible to invalidation only on a limited number of grounds.293
Most importantly, the mark can no longer be invalidated for being descriptive
and lacking the requisite secondary meaning.294 Tushnet presents
evidence of marks undeserving of incontestability status that are
allowed to claim it.295 This is troublesome generally and particularly so
for descriptive marks. Given the severe costs associated with the depletion
of descriptive terms,296 the Lanham Act should be amended either
to limit the availability of incontestable status for descriptive marks or
to allow challenges to a descriptive mark’s claim of acquired distinctiveness
even when that mark is incontestable.
Certain reforms directed toward new applicants may also help to
alleviate depletion and congestion by making it tougher to register
marks, with benefits and costs similar to those discussed above for existing
registrants.297 For example, registration fees could be increased,
perhaps in proportion to the degree of depletion or congestion in a particular
area. As for the use requirement, just as the PTO plans to do
with current registrants,298 the PTO could more strictly enforce the use
requirement against applicants through an auditing program. Relatedly,
the PTO could also tighten the relatively permissive standard allowing
the extension of time in which an intent-to-use applicant must file a
statement of use.299 Finally, the PTO might also insist on more robust
and direct evidence that applied-for descriptive marks have acquired
distinctiveness.300 Currently, the PTO allows acquired distinctiveness
to be established circumstantially, through evidence of advertising expenditures,
sales, prior registrations, and long-term use of the mark in
commerce.301 This evidence can often be quite weak.302 The PTO
might either require direct evidence of acquired distinctiveness, likely in
the form of survey evidence, or at least establish an adverse inference

that the lack of such evidence weighs heavily against a finding of acquired
distinctiveness.303
The reforms we have proposed so far are those that we think are the
most administratively feasible and politically viable. They are not, however,
the only policy levers that might be adjusted. We consider two
additional reforms that are more radical and whose effects on depletion
and congestion are more difficult to predict. On balance, we think each
is unlikely to result in net benefits to the trademark system.
First, with respect to the geographic extent of exclusive rights, the
Lanham Act could cease to grant constructive nationwide priority to
registered marks.304 In other words, registered trademark protection
could revert to a common law framework in which the registrant can
claim priority in a mark only in the geographic areas in which it is the
first to make actual use of the mark, plus any natural zone of expansion.305
Such a reform could conceivably diminish trademark depletion
because different firms could use the same mark in different geographic
areas provided that no consumer confusion results. This would represent
a significant break from current law, which allows a firm that owns
a registered mark it uses only in, say, Hawaii to assert priority rights
over the entirety of the United States.306 There are, however, several
problems with this approach. Most significantly, given the development
of the internet, many firms can now arguably claim that they use their
marks nationally online.307 There would also be the substantial administrative
burden of mapping out which geographic areas belong to which
registrants. Finally, such a reform would open the door to multiple parallel
uses and trademark congestion on a national scale. As the development
of internet technology intensifies even further, and as physical
travel increases, a framework of geographically limited parallel uses
would become increasingly untenable.
Second, the Lanham Act could be reformed to provide that the PTO
would no longer search the register to determine if an applied-for mark
is confusingly similar to an already-registered mark. In essence, the

1038 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
PTO would no longer act as the first filter of incoming trademark applications
on the question of confusing similarity; section 2(d) review
would be left entirely to current registrants, who would need to become
much more vigilant in monitoring applications and filing oppositions.
This has long been the approach of European Union trademark law.308
Here too, however, there are several problems in addition to the obvious
problem of shifting more monitoring costs onto current registrants.
Applied-for marks that the PTO might previously have refused as confusingly
similar might now slip through to registration without attracting
the notice of current registrants, thus diminishing the impact of depletion.
But this would at the same time result in the registration of
confusingly similar marks and leave lurking conflicts unresolved, making
them costlier to resolve down the line if they emerge. Furthermore,
to the extent that this reform would allow the registration of nonconfusingly
similar marks that would formerly have been filtered out by the
PTO’s review, the result would be an increase in parallel uses and trademark
congestion.
There is good reason to expect that changes like those we propose
here would significantly inhibit trademark depletion and congestion.
FDA rules that suppress trademark congestion for drugs, a harmful situation
we discuss above,309 provide an instructive case. The FDA,
tasked with ensuring public safety with regard to drugs, not only regulates
which drugs are to be approved for the market but also, in recent
years, which marks businesses might use to market and sell drugs once
approved.310 Applicants submit up to two proposed names for evaluation,

2017 on the European Union Trade Mark art. 8, 2017 O.J. (L 154) 1, 9–10. In 2007, the United
Kingdom Intellectual Property Office adopted a comparable approach, in which it searches earlier
trademarks and notifies the applicant of the existence of conflicting regulations. If the applicant
proceeds with the registration, the Office notifies the owners of the conflicting registrations (provided
they qualify for notification) and the owners may then oppose the applicant’s registration.

tended meaning of any prefixes or suffixes, and pharmacologic category.311
The FDA uses a rigorous multipronged approach to identify
which submitted names are too confusingly similar to an alreadyexisting
drug name, including a preliminary screening to identify common
errors; a search against already-established stems of drugs and
chemicals; a computerized approximate-matching search for orthographic,
phonetic, and packaging similarities; searches against drug databases;
and prescription simulation studies.312 Of the 500 names reviewed
annually, the FDA rejects “roughly one-third.”313 Owing to this
review, which keeps pharmaceutical brand names far apart from one
another and from preexisting chemical terms, one commentator notes
that “prescription drugs notoriously carry some of the most obscure
brand names in business,” with recent examples including “Celecoxib,
Linezolid and Metaxalone — names that don’t exactly roll off the
tongue.”314 Not surprisingly, our data show that there is comparatively
less congestion and lower rates of section 2(d) rejections in Class 5 (pharmaceuticals)
than other classes.315

there is less congestion, and also depletion, in Class 5 is that barriers to entry in this space are high.

1040 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
It is crucial to note that all of the recommended — and even proposed
but rejected — changes set forth above affect only the registration
of marks. Comparable reforms should be implemented outside of the
context of registration. Most pertinently, federal law also protects unregistered
marks.316 Such marks should be subject to the same heightened
requirements for the showing of use in commerce and, when they
are descriptive, for the showing of acquired distinctiveness.317 More
generally, in light of the harms of depletion and congestion, courts
should feel empowered to adjudicate more permissively the fair use defense,
both in its descriptive and normative forms.318 Relatedly, with
respect to the basic test for the likelihood of consumer confusion, courts
may increasingly be compelled to strike a difficult balance in which they
allow somewhat confusingly similar marks to remain in the marketplace
in order to promote competition, even though doing so may impose
greater search costs on consumers.319
Finally, at a minimum, policymakers, judges, and trademark examiners
should take into account depletion and congestion data like those
we have gathered here in any future reforms of trademark law. For
example, the PTO has recently proposed a new “Merely Informational
Matter” examination guide that seeks to tighten current standards on
the registration of matter that merely provides information about a good
or service and is not perceived by consumers as source denotative.320

[https://perma.cc/3KHN-ZVYD]. 316 It currently remains an important open question in trademark law whether unregistered
“common law” marks, which the Lanham Act protects, supra section I.A.4, pp. 961–62, ought to be
held to the same standards specified in the Lanham Act and developed by courts for registered
marks. See Tushnet, supra note 77, at 881–916; supra note 77 (discussing Tushnet’s work). 317 See supra pp. 1036–37. 318 See, e.g., KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 543 U.S. 111 (2004)

119, and holding that “some possibility of consumer confusion must be compatible with fair use,”
id. at 121). 319 See McKenna, supra note 241, at 86–92. Another possibility is to enable private actors to do
more to allocate trademarks among themselves as a way to ameliorate depletion and possibly congestion.
However, trademark law prohibits assignments in gross, which are sales of a trademark
divorced from its good will. See Topps Co. v. Cadbury Stani S.A.I.C., 526 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 2008)
(“An assignment ‘in gross’ is a purported transfer of a trademark divorced from its goodwill, and it
is generally deemed invalid under U.S. law.”). To facilitate a market in trademarks, trademark law
could become more permissive about allowing trademark assignments in gross.

in the future to aid in determining what matter in particular cases
should be deemed merely informational because it is highly congested.
In sum, the depletion and congestion data clearly show that, going
forward, trademark policy must address the degree to which depletion
and congestion impose significant barriers to entry on nonincumbents
and undercut the law’s central goals of promoting efficient competition
and reducing consumers’ search costs. Though we have only sketched
out in this section various reforms that may aid in reducing depletion
and congestion and mitigating their harms, we are confident that,
whether globally or on a case-by-case basis, the incorporation of data
like ours into the trademark policymaking and adjudication process will
greatly improve, if not preserve, the trademark system.
CONCLUSION
This Article has defined the phenomena of trademark depletion and
congestion, developed frameworks for evaluating their severity, and,
with respect to word marks, shown through a wide variety of empirical
evidence that both depletion and congestion are becoming increasingly
serious problems for the trademark system. As we explained above, we
do not expect ever to reach a condition in which we have “run out” of
trademarks. Firms will likely always be able to find, as they do now,
some minimally communicative sign by which to identify and distinguish
their goods or services. But as depletion and congestion continue
to intensify, firms will find such signs at greater cost and with less benefit.
Incumbent advantages will grow as will barriers to entry for nonincumbents.
Consumer search costs will continue to increase. More and
more of our daily language, both commercial and noncommercial, will
operate in the shadow of trademark property rights. What makes trademark
depletion and congestion so dangerous is that we may not fully
recognize these trends as they continue to mount — and as we continue
to try to adapt. Both processes are gradual. But this cannot be an
excuse for inaction. We think the reform proposals we have surveyed
above are a good place to start.
In the meantime, further work remains to be done to better understand
trademark depletion and congestion. Most important but also
most challenging will be the study of image mark depletion and congestion.
There is already strong anecdotal evidence that both processes
have reached chronic levels.321 A full understanding of depletion and

1042 HARVARD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 131:945
congestion should also incorporate semantic similarity, such as when a
mark like TORNADO for wire fencing precludes the registration of the
mark CYLCONE for the same goods.322 Our results are conservative
because we have not included this dimension of similarity. We additionally
hope to extend our framework and methods to other trademark systems,
most notably the European trademark system, and to other similar
naming regimes, such as the Delaware Corporate Registry and financial
market stock symbols. Finally, a great deal of work remains to be done
on specific trends revealed by the PTO’s Case Files Dataset, including
trends in applicants’ disclaiming of rights in parts of their marks, applicants’
reclaiming of marks abandoned by others, trademark licensing
practices, and the effects of registrations containing foreign words.
We expect that such work will further amplify the themes we have
pursued throughout this Article: that the supply of effective trademarks
is not inexhaustible, that the granting of trademark rights is not costless,
that the costs of granting such rights have been significantly increasing,
and thus that the ecology of the trademark system is undergoing increasing
strain. Over the two centuries of its development, the American
trademark system has always assumed the existence of an open frontier
of unclaimed, competitively effective trademarks. This assumption pervades
American trademark law and policy. Yet our data show that this
frontier is closing. Our hope is that the data will prompt recognition of
and guide adaption to this new condition.
